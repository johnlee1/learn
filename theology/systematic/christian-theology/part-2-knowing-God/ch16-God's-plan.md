## A Moderately Calvinistic Model
* What does it mean to say that I am free? It means that I am not under constraint. Thus, I am free to do whatever I please to do. But am I free with respect to what pleases me and what does not? To put it differently, I may choose one action over another because it holds more appeal for me. That is quite a different matter. I make all my decisions, but those decisions are in large measure influenced by certain characteristics of mine that I am not capable of altering by my own choice. If, for example, I am offered for dinner a choice between liver and any other entree, I am quite free to take the liver but I do not desire to do so. I have no conscious control over my dislike of liver. That is a given that goes with my being the person I am. In that respect my freedom is limited. I do not know whether my genes or environmental conditioning has caused my dislike of liver, but it is apparent that I cannot by mere force of will alter this characteristic of mine. Am I free to do as I wish? Yes, most certainly. Am I free to wish as I wish, however? That is a rather different question. 
* There are, then, limitations on who I am and what I desire and will. I certainly did not choose the genes that I have; I did not select my parents or the exact geographical location and cultural setting of my birth. My freedom, therefore, is within these limitations. And here arises the question: “Who set up these factors?” The theistic answer is, “God did.”
* I am free to choose among various options. But my choice will be influenced by who I am. Therefore, my freedom must be understood as my ability to choose among options in light of who I am. And who I am is a result of God’s decision and activity. God is in control of all the circumstances that bear on my situation in life. He may bring to bear (or permit to be brought to bear) factors that will make a particular option appealing, even powerfully appealing, to me. Through all the factors that have come into my experience in time past, he has influenced the type of person I now am. Indeed, he has affected what has come to pass by willing that it was I who was brought into being.
* Is God’s having rendered human decisions and actions certain compatible with human freedom? How we respond depends on our understanding of freedom. According to the position we are espousing, the answer to the question, “Could the individual have chosen differently?” Is yes, while the answer to the question, “But would she have?” Is no. In our understanding, for human freedom to exist, only the first question need to be answered in the affirmative. 
* God has a foreknowledge of possibilities. God foresees what possible beings will do if placed in particular situation with all the influences that will be present at that point in time and space. On this basis he chooses which of the possible individuals will become actualities and which circumstances and influences will be present.
* We must understand that the will of God permits rather than causes sin. God never says, “Commit this sin!” But by his permitting the conditions that lead a person to commit a sin and by his not preventing the sin, God in effect wills the sin.
