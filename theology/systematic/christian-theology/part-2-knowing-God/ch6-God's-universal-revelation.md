## Summary
THe study of God's revelation of himself to humanity has been classified in two ways: general revelation and special revelation. The general revelation of God has been found in three areas: nature, history, and humanity. Theologians concerned with the comprehensiveness of general revelation have developed what is known as natural theology. This theology studies the way in which God's existence is known outside the biblical source, specifically through the use of reason. Some theologians, such as Karl Barth, reject both general revelation and natural theology. The view presented here is that there is general revelation without natural theology, but the effect of sin prevents the unbeliever from coming to the knowledge of God. The salvation of the individual through God's general revelation can only be measured by faith. 

## The Nature of Revelation
* because humans are finite and God is infinite, if they are to know God, that knowledge must come about by GOd taking the initiative to make himself known
* two basic classifications of revelation:
    * general revelation: God's communication of himself to all persons at all times in all places
        * God's self-manifestation through nature, history, and the inner being of hte human person
        * general in two senses:
            * universal availability - it is accessible to all persons at all times
            * content of the message - it is less particularized and detailed than special revelation
    * special revelation: GOd's particular communications and manifestations of himself to partciular persons at particular times, communications and manifestations that are aailable now only by consultation of certain sacred writings

## The Loci of General Revelation
* traditional loci of general revelation are three: nature, history, and the constitution of the human being
* nature:
    * scripture proposes that there is a knowledge of God available through the created physical order
    * God has left evidence of himself in the world he has created
    * general revelation is most frequently thought of in connection with the creation's amazing and impressive character, pointing to a very powerful and wise person, capable of designing and producing intricate variety and beauty
* history:
    * scripture indicates in numerous places that God is moving the course of history, controlling the destinies of nations
    * if God is at work in the world and is moving toward certain goals, it should be possible to detect the trend of his work in events that occur as part of history
    * the evidence here is less impressive than that of nature. history is less accessible than is nature. one either will be dependent on secondhand materials, or will have to work from one's own limited experience of history
    * example of God's revelation in history is the preservation of the people of Israel. this small nation has survived over many centuries within a basically hostile environment, often in the face of severe opposition
* human:
    * in the moral and spiritual qualities of humankind that God's character is best perceived
    * the moral imperative requires the postulate of a life hereafter and of a divine guarantor of values
    * general revelation is also found in humanity's religious nature. in all cultures, at all times and places, humans have believed in the existence of a higher reality than themselves, and even of something higher than the human race collectively. many see in this universal tendency toward worship of the holy the manifestation of a past knowledge of God, an internal sense of deity, which, although it mahy be marred and distorted, is nonetheless still present and operating in human experience

## Biblical Passages Dealing with General Revelation
* psalm 19 - creation is a constant evidence of the greatness of the one who has made it
* constant witness, found everyone, the language of the created world is universal
* psalm 104 - declaration of God's creative work, a recitation of all that he has done. this inspires the psalmist to expressions of praise and worship. here the psalmist does not emphasize the witness that the creation gives to the Creator, but rather gives expression ot the effect that these works have on him, the observer
* this is a testimony that should be evident to those who view it. it is notable, however, that the psalmist who testifies to God's glory on the basis of the witness of the creation is a believer, who presumably has come to know God as a result of special revelation
* psalms indicate that a witness is objetively present in the creation. they do not indicate whether that witness brings about faith in Jehovah for someone who has not been exposed to his special revelatory action
* Romans 1 - reality and clarity of the witness. if there is a failure of knowledge, the problems appears not to lie with the witness itself. in nature we see something of nature's God
* Romans 2 - rather than being located in the external created world, the locus is the human heart. God has left within the human moral makeup some witness of his requirements for human beings
* narratives: descriptions of persons and of the type of faith they may have had withour prior exposure to the special revelation
    * "holy pagans" / "the Melchizedek factor":
        * Melchizedek came from outside the covenant community of Israel, and yet was a priest of the true God
        * Cornelius, who as a gentile "God-fearer" was, in the judgement of some, already a saved person when he came to Peter (Acts 10)
        * Abimelech, in Genesis 20, who seemed to know Jehovah
        * these instances are not as helpful in understanding the scope/efficacy of general revelation as we might hope. 
            * we don't know enough about Melchizedek to know the basis of his relationship with Jehovah. it may be that God appeared to him by a special revelation, not recorded for us in Scripture
            * Peter's recounting of Cornelius indicates that Cornelius did not experience salvation until Peter presented the gospel to him. an angelic appearance is special, not general, revelation.
            * in the case of Abimelech, we should observe that God appeared to him in a dream, one of the primary modalities of special revelation
    * perhaps more helpful are those cases where, when presented with special revelation, a person recognizes that the author is the true God
        * Pharoah
        * Nebuchadnezzar
        * sailors on the ship that Jonah took
        * when special revelation came, it awakened the realization of the general revelation's authenticity
    * speaker seems to assume some prior acquaintance with God
        * acts 14 - God has given witness of himself by the benevolent preservation of his creation
        * acts 17 - Paul had noticed an altar to an "unknown god" in the Athenians' place of worship. he proceeded to proclaim this god tothem. the god whom they sensed from their speculations, without special revelation, was the same God whom he knew from special manifestation. Paul also quotes an Athenian poet. a pagan poet had been able to come to a spiritual true without God's special revelation
* what biblical passageson general revelation tell us about God:
    * God exists (Psalm 19:1, Romans 1:19)
    * God is uncreated (Acts 17:24)
    * God is Creator (Acts 14:15)

    * Man should perform the good (Romans 2:15)
    * God will judge evil (Romans 2:15-16)
    * In sum : God's glory, divine nature, and moral demands are to some extent known through general revelation
