## Summary
Most people need a more personal understanding of God than is available through nature and general history. God has provided particular revelation of himself. The way by which personal revelation of God is fashioned includes God's dealing with persons, everyday human experience, and human language and understanding. The modalities that God uses include historical events, divine speech, and the incarnation of God in Christ. Theologians have disagreed as to whether special revelation is propositional or personal. The bible provides both cognitive and affective knowledge of God. Knowledge of God is possible because God bridges the gap between himself and humankind.

## The Definition and Necessity of Special Revelation
* special revelation = God's manifestation of himself to particular persons at definite times and places, enabling those persons to enter into a redemptive relationship with him
* special revelation was necessary because humans had lost the relationship of favor that they had with God prior to the fall. they needed to come to know God in a fuller way if the conditions of fellowship were once again to be met. this knowledge had to go beyond the initial or general revelation that was still available, because now, in addition to the natural limitation of human finiteness, there was also the moral limitation of human sinfulness

## The Style of Special Revelation

### The personal Nature of Special Revelation
* God reveals himself by telling his name
* God entered into personal covenants with individuals and with the nation of Israel
* psalms contain numerous testimonies of personal experience with God
* goal of Paul's life was a personal acquaintance with God
* all scripture is personal in nature. we find a series of specific or particular statements about concrete occurrences and facts. neither is scripture a formal theological presentation, with arguments and counterarguments, such as one would find in a theological textbook. nor are there systematized creedal statements
* there is little speculation about matters not directly concerned with God's redemptive working and his relationship with humankind. what God reveals is primarily himself as a person, and especially those dimensions of himself that are particularly significant for faith

### The Anthropic Nature of Special Revelation
* revelation must involve God's condescension. God has disclosed himself by a revelation in anthropic form. this should not be thought of as anthropomorphism as such, but as simply a revelation coming in human language and human categories of thought and action
* idioms of the day appear in scripture
* revelation is also anthropic in the sense that it often came in forms that are part of ordinary, everyday human experience - dreams
* Jesus incarnate came as a human, not an angel or a being clearly recognizable as a god
* much of the revelation was in the form of natural occurrences

### The Analogical Nature of Special Revelation
* God draws on those elements in the human universe of knowledge that can serve as a likeness of or that partially convey the truth in the divine realm. his revelation employs analogical language
* whenever God has revealed himself, he has selected elements that are univocal in his universe and ours. when describing God's actions, while there would be differences of method and materials from humans, the action is basically the same in its effect
* analogical = qualitatively teh same - ithe difference is one of degree rather than of kind - God is as powerful as humans are powerful, but much more so. humans having observed only finite forms, we find it impossible to grasp infinite concepts. in this sense, God always remain incomprehensible. we can not encompass God within our knowledge

## The Modes of Special Revelation

### Historical Events

#### Revelation in History
* what is authoritative about the bible is the narrative, which is to be understood as a recital of the historical events confessed by the people of Israel in the OT and the christian church in the NT. the bible is a record of the acts of God and the human response to those acts. biblical doctrine is inferred from the historical recital. the attributes of God are inferences drawn from the way God has acted. thus, the very concept of God is thought of not in terms of his being and essence, but rather of his acts

#### Revelation through History
* neo-orthodoxy: historical events should not be identified with revelation. they are merely the means through which revelation came. for revelation is not seen as the communication of information to humanity, but as God's presentation of himself. revelation is a personal encounter between God and human. for example, God spoke to moses, and one may record the words spoke by God, and another may read those words, and read the circumstances of the event, but one will not thereby have obtained revelation. revelation is not perecived as an occurrence of history. the event is merely the shell in which the revelation was clothed. rather, the revelation is something extra added to that event. it is God's direct coming to someone through that event. thus, the narrative of hte bible is not revelation as such, for the simple reason that the revelation cannot be captured and recorded. the bible is a record that revelation has occurred in the past. the bible becomes the Word of God only when God manifests himself to the person reading/hearing the bible
* truth is personal, not propositional. revelation is something that happens, not something that is. when the neo-orthodox speak of revelation, they have in mind the process as opposed to the product of revelation (what is said or written about it), and the revealing as opposed to what is revealed. revelation comes through the occurrences of history, but not as those events

#### Revelation as History
* God has acted in history in such a way that the events actually were and are revelation of himself. God's attributes are actually seen in, not simply inferred from, his actions in history.

### Divine Speech
* audible speaking. silent, inward hearing of God's message. dream. vision
* "concursive" inspiration - revelation and inspiration merged into one. as authors of Scripture wrote, God placed within their minds the thoughts he wished communicated. God created thoughts in the mind of the writer as he wrote
 * the spoken Word of God was the interpretation of an event. not only the event but also its interpretation was revelation from God. for example, the apostle's interpretation of Jesus' death

 ### The Incarnation
 * revelation through Jesus' acts, speech, character

 ## Special Revelation: Propositional or Personal?

## Scripture as Revelation
* if revelation is defined as only the actual occurrence, the process or the revealing, then the bible is not revelation. revelation is something that occurred long ago. if, however, revelation is also the product, the result or the revealed, then the bible may also be termed revelation

## Propositions or Narrative?
* both

## The Possibility of Knowledge of God
* Kant - we can never be absolutely sure that phenomenon (thing as it appears to us) is identical with the noumenon (thing as it is). in the case of supersensible objects, such as God, there is not even any phenomenon - therefore can't have knowledge of God
* response is that God is on a different level of reality than we are. a gap that cannot be bridged from the human side may not be quite such an insuperable difficulty from the divine side
