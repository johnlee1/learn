## Summary
Most people need a more personal understanding of God than is available through nature and general history. God has provided particular revelation of himself. The way by which personal revelation of God is fashioned includes God's dealing with persons, everyday human experience, and human language and understanding. The modalities that God uses include historical events, divine speech, and the incarnation of God in Christ. Theologians have disagreed as to whether special revelation is propositional or personal. The bible provides both cognitive and affective knowledge of God. Knowledge of God is possible because God bridges the gap between himself and humankind.

## The Definition and Necessity of Special Revelation
* special revelation = God's manifestation of himself to particular persons at definite times and places, enabling those persons to enter into a redemptive relationship with him
* special revelation was necessary because humans had lost the relationship of favor that they had with God prior to the fall. they needed to come to know God in a fuller way if the conditions of fellowship were once again to be met. this knowledge had to go beyond the initial or general revelation that was still available, because now, in addition to the natural limitation of human finiteness, there was also the moral limitation of human sinfulness

## The Style of Special Revelation

### The personal Nature of Special Revelation
* God reveals himself by telling his name
* God entered into personal covenants with individuals and with the nation of Israel
* psalms contain numerous testimonies of personal experience with God
* goal of Paul's life was a personal acquaintance with God
* all scripture is personal in nature. we find a series of specific or particular statements about concrete occurrences and facts. neither is scripture a formal theological presentation, with arguments and counterarguments, such as one would find in a theological textbook. nor are there systematized creedal statements
* there is little speculation about matters not directly concerned with God's redemptive working and his relationship with humankind. what God reveals is primarily himself as a person, and especially those dimensions of himself that are particularly significant for faith

### The Anthropic Nature of Special Revelation
* revelation must involve God's condescension. God has disclosed himself by a revelation in anthropic form. this should not be thought of as anthropomorphism as such, but as simply a revelation coming in human language and human categories of thought and action
* idioms of the day appear in scripture
* revelation is also anthropic in the sense that it often came in forms that are part of ordinary, everyday human experience - dreams
* Jesus incarnate came as a human, not an angel or a being clearly recognizable as a god
* much of the revelation was in the form of natural occurrences

### The Analogical Nature of Special Revelation
* God draws on those elements in the human universe of knowledge that can serve as a likeness of or that partially convey the truth in the divine realm. his revelation employs analogical language
* whenever God has revealed himself, he has selected elements that are univocal in his universe and ours. when describing God's actions, while there would be differences of method and materials from humans, the action is basically the same in its effect
* analogical = qualitatively teh same - ithe difference is one of degree rather than of kind - God is as powerful as humans are powerful, but much more so. humans having observed only finite forms, we find it impossible to grasp infinite concepts. in this sense, God always remain incomprehensible. we can not encompass God within our knowledge
