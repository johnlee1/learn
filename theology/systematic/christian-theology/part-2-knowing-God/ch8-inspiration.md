## Summary
Inspiration is necessary because it confirms the nature of God's special revelation through Scripture. An important part of theology is the formulation of a theory of the extent to which the Bible is inspired. A variety of theories have been propounded. These are scrutinized and evaluated. Over centuries the biblical writers support a high view of inspiration. While in the proper sense, inspiration is of the writers, in the derivative sense, we may also say that the writings themselves are inspired.

## Definition of Inspiration
* by inspiration of scripture we mean that supernatural influence of the Holy Spirit on the Scripture writers that rendered their writings an accurate record of the revelation or that resulted in what they wrote actually being the Word of God

## A Model of Inspiration
* inspiration is conceived of as applying to both the writer and the writing. in the primary sense, the writer is the object of the inspiration. as the writer pends scripture, however, the quality of inspiredness is communicated to the writing as well. it is inspired in a derivative sense. (it should be observed that 2 Peter 1:20-21 refers to the authors, while 2 Timothy 3:16 refers to what they wrote.) this is much like the definition of revelation as both the revealing and the revealed. we have observed that inspiration presupposes an extended period of God's working with the writer. this involves not only the preparation of the writer, but also the preparation of the material for this use. while inspiration in the strict sense probably does not apply to the preservation and transmission of this material, the providence that guides this process should not be overlooked
