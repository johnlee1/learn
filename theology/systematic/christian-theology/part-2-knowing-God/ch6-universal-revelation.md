## Summary
The study of God's revelation of himself to humanity has been classified in two ways: general revelation and special revelation. The general revelation of God has been found in three areas: nature, history, and humanity. Theologians concerned with the comprehensiveness of general revelation have developed what is known as natural theology. This theology studies the way in which God's existence is known outside the biblical source, specifically through the use of reason. Some theologians, such as Karl Barth, reject both general revelation and natural theology. The view presented here is that there is general revelation without natural theology, but the effect of sin prevents the unbeliever from coming to the knowledge of God. The salvation of the individual through God's general revelation can only be measured by faith. 

## The Nature of Revelation
* because humans are finite and God is infinite, if they are to know God, that knowledge must come about by GOd taking the initiative to make himself known
* two basic classifications of revelation:
    * general revelation: God's communication of himself to all persons at all times in all places
        * God's self-manifestation through nature, history, and the inner being of hte human person
        * general in two senses:
            * universal availability - it is accessible to all persons at all times
            * content of the message - it is less particularized and detailed than special revelation
    * special revelation: GOd's particular communications and manifestations of himself to partciular persons at particular times, communications and manifestations that are aailable now only by consultation of certain sacred writings

## The Loci of General Revelation
* traditional loci of general revelation are three: nature, history, and the constitution of the human being
* nature:
    * scripture proposes that there is a knowledge of God available through the created physical order
    * God has left evidence of himself in the world he has created
    * general revelation is most frequently thought of in connection with the creation's amazing and impressive character, pointing to a very powerful and wise person, capable of designing and producing intricate variety and beauty
* history:
    * scripture indicates in numerous places that God is moving the course of history, controlling the destinies of nations
    * if God is at work in the world and is moving toward certain goals, it should be possible to detect the trend of his work in events that occur as part of history
    * the evidence here is less impressive than that of nature. history is less accessible than is nature. one either will be dependent on secondhand materials, or will have to work from one's own limited experience of history
    * example of God's revelation in history is the preservation of the people of Israel. this small nation has survived over many centuries within a basically hostile environment, often in the face of severe opposition
* human:
    * in the moral and spiritual qualities of humankind that God's character is best perceived
    * the moral imperative requires the postulate of a life hereafter and of a divine guarantor of values
    * general revelation is also found in humanity's religious nature. in all cultures, at all times and places, humans have believed in the existence of a higher reality than themselves, and even of something higher than the human race collectively. many see in this universal tendency toward worship of the holy the manifestation of a past knowledge of God, an internal sense of deity, which, although it mahy be marred and distorted, is nonetheless still present and operating in human experience

## Biblical Passages Dealing with General Revelation
* psalm 19 - creation is a constant evidence of the greatness of the one who has made it
* constant witness, found everyone, the language of the created world is universal
* psalm 104 - declaration of God's creative work, a recitation of all that he has done. this inspires the psalmist to expressions of praise and worship. here the psalmist does not emphasize the witness that the creation gives to the Creator, but rather gives expression ot the effect that these works have on him, the observer
* this is a testimony that should be evident to those who view it. it is notable, however, that the psalmist who testifies to God's glory on the basis of the witness of the creation is a believer, who presumably has come to know God as a result of special revelation
* psalms indicate that a witness is objetively present in the creation. they do not indicate whether that witness brings about faith in Jehovah for someone who has not been exposed to his special revelatory action
* Romans 1 - reality and clarity of the witness. if there is a failure of knowledge, the problems appears not to lie with the witness itself. in nature we see something of nature's God
* Romans 2 - rather than being located in the external created world, the locus is the human heart. God has left within the human moral makeup some witness of his requirements for human beings
* narratives: descriptions of persons and of the type of faith they may have had withour prior exposure to the special revelation
    * "holy pagans" / "the Melchizedek factor":
        * Melchizedek came from outside the covenant community of Israel, and yet was a priest of the true God
        * Cornelius, who as a gentile "God-fearer" was, in the judgement of some, already a saved person when he came to Peter (Acts 10)
        * Abimelech, in Genesis 20, who seemed to know Jehovah
        * these instances are not as helpful in understanding the scope/efficacy of general revelation as we might hope. 
            * we don't know enough about Melchizedek to know the basis of his relationship with Jehovah. it may be that God appeared to him by a special revelation, not recorded for us in Scripture
            * Peter's recounting of Cornelius indicates that Cornelius did not experience salvation until Peter presented the gospel to him. an angelic appearance is special, not general, revelation.
            * in the case of Abimelech, we should observe that God appeared to him in a dream, one of the primary modalities of special revelation
    * perhaps more helpful are those cases where, when presented with special revelation, a person recognizes that the author is the true God
        * Pharoah
        * Nebuchadnezzar
        * sailors on the ship that Jonah took
        * when special revelation came, it awakened the realization of the general revelation's authenticity
    * speaker seems to assume some prior acquaintance with God
        * acts 14 - God has given witness of himself by the benevolent preservation of his creation
        * acts 17 - Paul had noticed an altar to an "unknown god" in the Athenians' place of worship. he proceeded to proclaim this god tothem. the god whom they sensed from their speculations, without special revelation, was the same God whom he knew from special manifestation. Paul also quotes an Athenian poet. a pagan poet had been able to come to a spiritual true without God's special revelation
* what biblical passageson general revelation tell us about God:
    * God exists (Psalm 19:1, Romans 1:19)
    * God is uncreated (Acts 17:24)
    * God is Creator (Acts 14:15)
    * God is Sustainer (Acts 14:16; 17:25)
    * God is universal Lord (Acts 17:24)
    * God is self-sufficient (Acts 17:25)
    * God is transcendent (Acts 17:24)
    * God is immanent (Acts 17:26-27)
    * God is eteranl (Psalm 93:2)
    * God is great (Psalm 8:3-4)
    * God is majestic (Psalm 29:4)
    * God is powerful (Psalm 29:4; Romans 1:20)
    * God is wise (Psalm 104:24)
    * God is good (Acts 14:17)
    * God is righteous (Romans 1:32)
    * God has a sovereign will (Acts 17:26)
    * God has standards of right and wrong (Romans 2:15)
    * God should be worshipped (Acts 14:15; 17:23)
    * Man should perform the good (Romans 2:15)
    * God will judge evil (Romans 2:15-16)
    * In sum : God's glory, divine nature, and moral demands are to some extent known through general revelation

## Differing Assessments of the Value of General Revelation

### Natural Theology
* it is actually possible to gain some true knowledge of God from these spheres - in other words, to construct a theology apart from the bible
* assumptions:
    * there is an objective, valid, and rational general revelation - that God actually has made himself known in nature and that patterns of meaning are objectively present - independently of whether anyone perceives, understands, and accepts this revelation. truth about God is actually present within the creation, not projected upon it by a believer who already knows God from other sources, such as the bible. assumes that nature is basically intact: that it has not been substantially distorted by anything that has occurred since the creation. in short, the world we find about us is basically the world as it came from God's creative hand, and as it was intended to be
    * the integrity of the person perceiving and learning from the creation. neither humanity's natural limitations nor the effects of sin and the fall prevent humans from recognizing and correctly interpreting the Creator's handiwork
    * there is congruity between the human mind and the creation about us. the mind's coherence with the world order enables inferences from the data it perceives. the validity of hte laws of logic is also assumed. such logical principles as the law of identity, the law of contradiction, and the law of excluded middle are not merely abstract mental constructs, but are true of the world. avoid paradoxes and logical contradictions, considering them something to be removed by a more complete logical scrutiny of the issues under consideration
* the core of natural theology is the idea that it is possible, without a prior commitment of faith to the beliefs of Christianity, and without relying on any special authority, such as an institution (the church) or a document (the Bible), to come to a genuine knowledge of God on the basis of reason alone
* Thomas Aquinas - all truth belong to one of two realms. the lower realm is the realm of nature, the higher is the realm of grace. while the claims pertaining to the upper realm must be accepted on authority, those in the lower realm may be known by reason
* in Thomas's time the church was coming into contact with heterogeneous cultures. it was of no value to quote one's authority (bible) to these persons. if any real imapct was to be made on these persons, it would be necessary to enter some neutral arena where no special authority need to be appealed to, adn to settle the matter on terms accepted by all rational persons
* Thomas contended that he could prove certain beliefs by pure reason
    * cosmological proof - in the realm of our experience, everything that we know is caused by something else. there cannot, however, be an infinite regress of causes, for if that were the case, the whole series of causes would never have begun. there must, therefore, be some uncaused or necessary being
    * teoleological argument - various parts of the universe exhibits behavior that is adaptive or that helps bring about desiriable ends. when such behavior is displayed by human beings, we recognize that they have consciously willed and directed themselves toward that end. some objects in our universe, however, cannot have done any purposive planning. certainly rocks and atmosphere haev not chosen to be as they are. their ordering according to a purpose or design must have come from somewhere else
* anthropological argument
    * Kant's formulation - we all possess a moral impulse or a categorical imperative. following this impulse by behaving morally is not very well rewarded within this life, however. why should one be moral then? would it not be wiser to act selfishly at times? there must be some basis for ethics and morality, some sort of reward, which in turn involves several factors - immortality and an undying soul, a coming time of judgement, and a God who establishes and supports values, and who rewards good and punishes evil. thus, the moral order requires the existence of God
* ontological argument
    * Anselm's formulation - God is the greatest of all conceivable beings. now a being that does not exist cannot be the greatest of all conceivable beings, for the nonexistent being of our conceptions would be greater if it had the attribute of existence. therefore, by definition, God must exist. 
    * Kant's response: existence is not an attribute. a being that exists does not have some attribute or quality lacked by a similar being that does not exist. if i imagine a dollar and compare it with a real dollar, there is no difference in their essence, in what they are. the only difference is in whether they are. there is a logical difference between the sentence "God is good" and the sentence "God is." the former predicates some quality of God; the latter is a statement of existence. the point here is that existence is not a necessary predicate of the greatest of all conceivable beings. such a being may exist, or it may not. in either case its essence is the same

### The Denial of General Revelation
* in the first half of 20th century, Karl Barth rejected both natural theology and general revelation. Barth had liberal education but witnessed political developments arising from liberal's theological conclusions affirming general revelation and natural theology
* Barth's assumptions:
    * God's revelation is exclusively in Jesus Christ
    * Genuine revelation is always responded to positively rather than being ignored or rejected
    * Knowledge of God is always redemptive or salvific in nature

### Evaluation of These Two Views
* natural theology
    * modern criticisms of cosmological argument and teological argument
    * even if the arguments succeed in proving the existence of a divine being, there is still a problem if this is to be considered a proof for the christian God
* rejection of general revelation
    * ignores plain reading of scripture - Psalm 19

### General Revelation, but without Natural Theology
* God gives us an objective, valid, rational revelation of himself in nature, history, and human personality. regardless of whether anyone actually observes it, understands it, and believes it, even though it may well have been disturbed by the fall, it is nonetheless present. general revelation is not something read into nature by those who know God on other grounds; it is already present, by God's work of creation and continuing providence
* humans do not clearly recognize and acknowledge God in the general revelation. sin has a double effect on the efficacy of the general revelation: 
    * on the one hand, sin has marred the witness of the general revelation. creation's witness is somewhat refracted. while it is still God's creation and thus continues to witness to him, it is not quite what it was when it came from the handof hte Maker. it is a spoiled creation. the testimony to the Maker is blurred
    * sin has caued blindness and darkness of humans' understanding. this blindness would affect the ability to see God in the creation as well
* general revelation evidently does not ordinarily enable the unbeliever to come to the knowledge of God. Apostle Paul's statements about general revelation must be viewed in the light of what he says about sinful humanity and the urgency of telling people about Christ. thus in Paul's mind the possibility of constructing a full-scale natural theology seems seriously in question
* faith is needed to see God in creation
* scripture contains nothing constituting a formal argument for the existence of God from the evidences within the general revelation

## General Revelation and Human Responsibility
* one view is that general revelation through nature and the internal law should cause a person to reach the conclusion that he or she is not fulfilling that standard. the knowledge of God all people have, if they do not suppress it, is that they are guilty in relationship to God. persons who come to a belief in a single powerful God, who despair of any works-righteousness to please this holy God, and who throw themselves upon the mercy of this good God would be accepted as were the OT believers. the basis of acceptance would be the work of Jesus Christ, even though the person involved is not conscious that this is how provision has been made for his or her salvation
* "it seems to me that the wisest response to this perplexing issue is to recognize that we cannot rule out the possibility that some who never hear hte gospel might, neverhteless, through God's grace, respond to what they know of God through general revelation and turn to him in faith for forgiveness. but to go beyond this and to speculate about how many, if any, are saved this way is to move beyond what the scriptures allow"

## Implications of General Revelation
* 1. there is a common ground for a point of contact between the believer and the nonbeliever, or between the gospel and the thinking of the unbeliever. all persons have a knowledge of God. although it may be suppressed to the extent of being unconscious or unrecognizable, it is nonetheless there, and there will be areas of sensitvity to which the gospel message may be effectively directed as a starting point. these areas of sensitivity will cary from one person to another, but there are features of the creation to which the believer may point, features that will enable the unbeliever to recognize something of the truth of the message
* 2. we may understand more about the specially revealed truth by examining the general revelation
* 3. God is just in condemning those who have never heard the gospel in the full and formal sense. no one is completely without opportunity. all have known God; if they have not effectually perceived him, it is because they have suppressed the truth. thus all are responsible
* 4. general revelation serves to explain the worldwide phenomenon of religion and religions. all persons are religious, because all have a type of knowledge of God
* 5. since both creation and the gospel are intelligible and coherent revelations of God, there is harmony between the two, and mutual reinforcement of one by the other
* 6. in a pluralistic society, religious sources may not be appealed to in disputes over matters of ethics and politics. general revelation provides a possibility of arguing for these on a broader basis
* 7. as the third world church continues to grow, we may expect a greater interest in nature and matters related to it. this will not take the form of formal arguments, so much as a direct relationship to and appreciation for nature, as the locus of God's activity
* 8. genuine knowledge and genuine morality in unbelieving humans are not their own accomplishments. truth arrived at apart from special revelation is God's truth. knowledge/morality are not so much discovery as they are "uncovery" of the truth God has structured into his entire universe, both physical and moral
