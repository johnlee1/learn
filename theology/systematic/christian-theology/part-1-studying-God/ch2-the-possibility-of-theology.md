## Summary
Modernism, the view that dominated thinking from the 18th century through the late 20th centuries, emphasized rationality and certainty. As modernism fell out of favor, postmodernism rejected modern foundationalism as a test for truth, asserting that all knowledge is conditioned. This has affected many intellectual endeavors, including theology. Although the question regarding the purpose of doctrine has been answered in a variety of ways, the most acceptable is taht doctrine is cognitive. Admitting that even doctrinal views are biased, we have several ways by which to reduce the effects of this conditioning upon theology. Theology is an activity of the church in which believers may be engaged at three levels: the practicing believer, those who teach other believers, and the theoreticians. Theology is possible.

## The Changing Context of Theologizing

### Modernism
* modern period, 18-20th centuries, belief in human rationality and the rationality of the universe
* events are explained in terms of the social realities that caused them, rather than in terms of the purpose of a transcendent God
* classic foundationalism, a common characteristic of modern throught - the basing of one's thinking on some indubitable or obvious principles, from which reasoning can then proceed
* modernism has been essentially humanistic. the human being is the center of reality, and in a sense everything exists for the sake of the human
* together with humanism is naturalism. paralleling the shift from God to humanity is the shift from anything heavenly or ethereal to the earth
* the scientific method has increasingly come to be considered virtually the only means of investigating truth
* nature is considered dynamic, and the sole and sufficient cause and explanation of all that occurs
* determinism is a strong element in modernism. there are certain regularities within reality, which can be discovered and formulated into laws
* scientific method also tends to be practiced in a reductionistic fashion. objects of study are regarded as "nothing but" something more basic
* there is a strong tendency towards foundationalism. the attempt to ground knowledge on some sure first principles
* there is a commitment to metaphysical realism. the objects of scientific inquiry are external to the consciousness of the knower, existing independently of any perception of them
* representative view of language. language refers to real objects that are extralinguistic
* correspondence theory of truth. truth is a measure of propositions and is present in those propositions, which correctly correspond to the states of affairs that they claim to present
* theology had to battle to establish its respectability, that is, its status as knowledge, in a world that tended to exalt science and reduce knowledge to the scientific

### Postmodernism
* postmodernism represents a rejection of modernism's approach
* denies the possibility of systematic description of things, so that an attempt to describe and analyze it is an impossibility
* the conditioned nature of knowledge. knowledge is conditioned, that is, affected by one's situation geographically and culturally. we really do not know the object of knowledge directly or as it is, but through the filter of our own experience and setting. the objetivity that modernist sought is an illusion. knowledge is relative to the knower. community is the check upon unbridled variety
* the locus of meaning. with respect to texts, meaning does not reside exclusively within the text, in the sense of what the author intended to say thereby. rather, the meaning of the text is the meaning as interpreted, that is, the meaning that it has to the reader. there is a "fusion of horizons", in which the meaning intended by the author and the meaning understood by the reader interact
* skepticism toward all-inclusive theories. modernists were seeking one explanation that would account for everything. postmodernists reject these "metanarratives"
    * no theory can be constructed by finite humans, who cannt know everything
    * historically has been used to justify oppression
    * perspectival character of knowledge - no truth that is the same truth for everyone
    * metanarratives are only constructed by ignoring certain considerations, and so much be "deconstructed" by calling attention to these contradictory elements
* distrust of the efficacy of reason as the sole source of knowledge. truth is the product, not the producer, of power. those who have the ability to do so decide what shall be the truth
* diminution of the value of propositions. truth can oftne be better conveyed in story form, or telling one's personal experiences rather than the use of propositions. preference for personal experience over experiment or investigation
* rejection of foundationalism. prefers coherentism or pragmatism. coherentism is the theory that the truth of propositions is demonstrated by their coherence with other propositions believed true. pragmatism is the theory that the truth of propositions is demonstrated by their practical effects
* lessened optimism about the benefits of knowledge
* questions whether we can know anything with certainty
* one insight that a postmodern theology certainly must accept and utilize is the fact that we do our investigation and our thinking from aparticular perspective, imposing certain limitations on our understanding. distinction between the truth and our knowledge of the truth

## The Nature of Doctrine
* different answers to the nature/purpose of doctrine:
    * doctrine as conveyor of truth. dominant view throughout church history cognitive view of doctrine. descriptive character. doctrines make statements that have truth value. this corresponded to the idea of religion as cognitive, or as involving belief (this is the best answer)
    * doctrine as interpretation of experience
    * practical action. doctrine as a matter of value judgements and thus of practical activity
    * doctrine as linguistic rules. neither truth claims nor expressions of experience, but rather operating rules of Christian communities
    * doctrine as the story of God's working. rather than being expressed ina collection of propositions, doctrines should be thought of as a narrative of God's activity

## Perspectivism and Ideology
* because all thought proveeds from a specific point within history and culture, that situation influences what is seen, thought, and understood. there is no absolute and unlimited perspective, no neutral standing point from which one can view reality as it is. however, opinions are presented as if they are not merely another culturally bound perspective; they carry the tone of being the way things really are. this seeming blindness is so common possibly because of the following
    * chronocentism - idea that one's present time is not only superior to preceding periods; it is unique. it is superior to any that might follow
    * one is simply so unable to escape one's own perspective as to be incapable of recognizing that it is just that, a perspective. one's own conditioning is so complete that it shields one from the recognition that one is not working from a neutral viewpoint
    * one may hold the view that power makes truth, so if one is able to ssert one's view and have that assertion go unchallenged, that person should simply go ahead and do so

## Theology beyond Postmodernism
* all views are conditioned and therefore biased, but this is not the conclusion of the matter, but rather a transitional point. we must go beyond this to actively attempt to reduce the effect of this conditioning on our own outlook. perfect objectivity is not attainable, but it is desirable, and as close an approximation as possible should be pursued

### Postperspectivism
* postperspectivism is taking seriously the reality of perspectivism, but going beyond it. our theology must take full account of the fact of conditioning and perspectivism, as enunciated so forcefully by postmodernism. then however, we will aim to decontextualize ourselves and our knowlege of things, to the maximum degree pratical
* several helpful activities to improve the situation include:
    * write one's intellectual autobiography. identify factors that affect how one perceives things
    * interaction with different perspectives. 
* suspend the approach of examining the other viewpoint with the conviction that it is wrong. instead, we will try to ask honestly, "Why does this look so persusasive to this other person or group?". it will mean attempting to critique our own position, to play the proverbial devil's advocate with ourselves. we will therefore seek out the best and most persuasive advocates of different viewpoints. we will ask ourselves, "If I were assigned the task of refuting the position I currently hold, what would I say?". we should not expect that attining the ability to be more objective will be a quick, easy, or complete process. we will want to consciously remind ourselves of our own fallibility and limitation, and hold our convictions with a degree of humility, so that we can correct ourselves as the process goes on

### Correspondence View of Truth
* the correspondence view says that propositions are true if they correctly describe things as they are
* the coherence view of truth is that propositions are true if they agree with, or cohere with, other propositions
* the pragmatic theory is that propositions are true if they work out in practice
* in reality, these tend to be more a question of the tests or measures of truth than of the nature of truth
* weakness with coherence view: coherence is a necessary but not a sufficient test of truth
* weakness with pragmatic theory: a particular proposition or belief may work out very well in the short term, but one that does not agree with reality will not work well in the long term

### Neofoundationalism
* there are basic propositions
* any justified empirical proposition either is basic or derives its justification, at least in part, from the fact that it stands in an appropriate relationship to propositions which are basic. in short, there are propositions that are starting points, and others that follow from them. there is a hierarchical structure to knowledge
* the idea of the absolute certainty of these starting points is not inherent in foundationalism, being found only in classical foundationalism. this feature has been the primary object of attack by postmodernists

### Common Logic
* objective logic is essential. logic can be trusted and employed in doing theology
* classical objectivism: not an absolutism that believes that one has perfect understanding of reality, but rather a belief that such knowledge is possible and desirable, and endeavors to approximate it ever more closely. it will utilize imagination and creativity in formulating its models and hypotheses
* critical thinking and sanctified imagination both are needed to formulate new ways of conceiving of spiritual and theological truths and models of doctrines. in the final analysis, however, the products of imagination and intuition must be tested by other methods as well. "trust, but verify"

## Faith, Doctrine, and Theology
* "three-tiered model" describes different aspects of ethics and morality
    * on the first tier are the actors, those engaged in the practice of a given activity
    * on the second level are the critics, who evaluate the actions of those on the first level
    * finally, there are the philosophers, who debate the criteria of criticism empoyed by the critics
* on the bottom level are believing and practicing Christians. their faith is in God, through Jesus Christ, and they are engaged in living the Christian life. doctrines, or beliefs about the nature of God and his relationship to the world, are embedded in their experience and activity, whether they can enunciate these consciously or not. typically, this first-level activity cannot be done effectively until the knowledge becomes incorporated into the person's very nature. the very fact that this knowledge or belief is not consciously reflected on may not cause some people not to recognize that it is there, but it is. so doctrine is present at the most basic level, even though it may be implicit. here is where all Christians must live
* on the second level is the conscious reflection on doctrine that we may term theology. it is engaged in by those who teach other believers. it involves a more sophisticated version of Christian faith, in which practicing believers seek to understand the meaning of Christian faith and life more fully. it is an attempt to think through more precisely just what is meant by these doctrinal beliefs, and to interrelate them in a more intentional fashion. it also is directed to examining the doctrines in light of hte sources of doctrine, to make certain that the former relate as correctly as possible to the latter. at the same time, those who function on this level must also be negaged in the practice of Christianity. they are not merely detached, objective students of religious phenomena
* the third level consists of those who are the theoreticians of theology, who think through the meaning and possiblities of theology, seeking to refine it and relate it to new developments, cultural and otherwise. they also need ot be practicinfg believers and have some experience in mentoring others
