## Summary
Theology in a Christian context is a discipline of study that seeks to understand the God revealed in the Bible and to provide a Christian understanding of reality. It seeks to understand God's creation, particularly human beings and their condition, and God's redemptive work in relation to humankind. Biblical, historical, and philosophical theology provide insights and understandings that help lead toward a coherent whole. Theology has practical value in providing guidance for the Christian life and ministry.

## The Nature of Religion
* religion is belief or doctrine, feeling or attitudes, and a  way of life or manner of behaving
* the actual living-out and personal practice of religion occur on the level of primary experience
* there is also a level of reflection on what is occurring on the primary level. the discipline that concerns itself with describing, analyzing, criticizing, and organizing the doctrines is theology
* theology is a second-level activity as contrasted with religion. it is to religion what psychology is to human emotions, what aesthetics is to works of art, what political science is to political behavior
* other concepts of religion and of doctrine
    * pragmatic view: religion consists primarily of its doctrinal teachings in propositional form. religion is clearly pragmatic, concerned with alleviating the injustices within the human race. the role of doctrine is to speak to those inequities. theology becomes critical reflection on praxis.
    * subjective view: religion is an expression of emotional experience. essence of religion is an experience of the one great reality. doctrine are the differing interpretations various groups of people place on this generic experience as they interpret it through the grid of their own culture
    * cultural-linguistic view: religion is a set of categories or teachings that each culture constructs to interpret life and on the basis of which its members function. it does not grow out of experience so much as it shapes it. it is a story, told by its adherents, on the basis of which they make sense of life. doctrines is a second-level activity that serves a regulative function. rather than giving us ontological knowledge about God, doctrines are rules governing the community
* christian view of religion
    * doctrines consist of genuine knowledge about God
    * religion involves the whole person: intellect, emotions, and will
    * two major advantages of this view not possessed by other views
        * enables us to account for the full richness and complexity of human religions
        * fits more closely the actual understanding of religion and doctrine with which the early church and the authors of Scripture work
        * fits the average Christian's understanding and practice of the Christian life
        * other dimensions of Christian experience, such as the ethical application of Christian teachings and the wholehearted praise of God involved in worship, are intimately tied to our doctrinal udnerstanding. but they are complementary, not alternatives to it

## The Definition of Theology
* theology is the discipline that strives to give a coherent statement of the doctrines of the Christian faith, based primarily on the Scriptures, placed in the context of culture in general, worded in a contemporary idiom, and related to issues of life
* five key aspects of the task of theology
    * theology is biblical: primary source of its content the canonical Scriptures of the OT & NT
    * theology is systematic: draws on the entire bible. relate the various portions to one antoher to coalesce the varied teachings into some type of harmonious/coherent whole
    * theology relates to the issues of general culture and learning: for example, it attempts to relate its view of origins to the concepts advanced by science, its view of human nature to psychology's understanding of personality, its conception of providence to the work of philosophy of history, and so on
    * theology is contemporary: while it treats timeless issues, it must use language, concepts, and thought forms that make some sense in the context of hte present time
    * theology is practical: theology relates to living rather than merely to belief. the Christian faith gives us help with our practical concerns

## Locating Systematic Theology on the Theological Map
* in the broadest usage, theology encompasses all subjects treated in a theological or divinity school (biblical studies, historical studies, doctrinal studies, practical studies). in this sense it includes such diverse subjects as OT, NT, church history, evangelism, missions, systematic theology, philosophy of religion, Christian ethics, preaching, pastoral ministry, and counseling
* a narrower sense of the word refers to those endeavors that treat the specifically doctrinal character of the Christian faith. biblical theology, historical theology, systematic theology, philosophical theology

### Biblical Theology
* biblical theology is the theological content of the OT and NT
* systematic theology is systematic biblical theology contemporized
* biblical theology is the raw material with which systematic theology works

### Historical Theology
* historical theology studies the systematic theologies held and taught by various theologians throughout the history of the church
* two majors way to organize historical theology
    * synchronic approach (history of Christian thought): studying the theology of a given time with respect to several key areas of doctrine. thus, the theology of each successive period of time would be examined sequentially
    * diachronic approach (history of doctrines): trace the history of thought regarding a given doctrine down through the periods of the church's life
* historical theology makes us more self-conscious and self-critical, more aware of our own presuppositions. observing how culture influenced theological thinking in the past should call our attention to what is happening to us
* historical theology teaches us way to do theology by studying how others have done it before us
* historical theology may provide a means of evaluating a particular idea. ideas that seem so novel today have actually had precursors at earlier periods in the life of the church. history is theology's laboratory, in which it can assess the ideas that it espouses or considers espousing. if we closely examine some of our "new" ideas in the light of the history of the church, we will find that they are actually new forms of old conceptions

### Philosophical Theology
* there are three contributions different theologians believe philosophy may make to theology
    * philosophy may supply content for theology
    * philosophy may defend theology or establish its truth
        * weighing the truth-claims advanced by theology and giving part of the basis for accepting the message
    * philosophy may scrutinize its concepts and arguments
        * major value of philosophy for theologian: scrutiny of the meaning of terms and ideas employed in the theologyical task, the criticizing of its arguments, and the sharpening of the message for clarity
* Karl Barth reacted vigorously against the first of the three functions, and to a considerable extent against the second
* third function is generally considered valid
* Erickson believes philosophy, within somewhat restricted scope, performs the second function

## The Need for Theology
* theology is important because correct doctrinal beliefs are essential to the relationship between the believer and God
* theology is necessary because truth and experience are related
* theology is needful because of the large number of alternatives and challenges abroad at the present time

## The Starting Point of Theology
* instead of beginning either with God, the object of knowledge, or the Bible, the means of knowledge, we may begin with both. rather than attempting to prove one of the other, we may presuppose both as part of a basic thesis, then proceed to develop the knowledge that flows from this thesis and assess the evidence for its truth
* both God and his self-revelation are presupposed together, or perhaps we might think of the self-revealing God as a single presupposition. the starting point is - "There exists one Triune, loving, all-powerful, holy, all-knowing God who has revealed himself in nature, history, and human personality, and in those acts and words that are now preserved in the canonical Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments"
* from this basic postulate we may proceed to elaborate an entire theological system by unfolding the contents of the Scriptures. this system in turn will function as a worldview, that can be tested for truth. while no specific part is proved antecedently to the rest, the system as a whole can be verified/validated

## Theology as Science
* theology has a definite suject matter to ivnestigate, primarily that which God has revealed about Himself
* theology deals with objective matters
* theology has a definite methodology for investigating its subject matter
* theology has a method for verifying its propositions
* there is coherence among the propositions of its subject matter
* theology is subject to vertain basic principles or axioms
* theology involves communicability
* theology employes methods employed by other speciric disciplines. it shows a particular affinity for the methodology of history/philosophy
* theology shares some subject matter with other disciplines
* theology has its own unique status
    * deals with unique objects or with common objects in a unique way
    * considers humanity in a different light than other sciences
    * considers what God has revealed about humankind; thus it has data of its own
    * considers humans in relationship to God; thus it treats the human within a frame of reference not examined by any of the other disciplines

## Why the Bible?
* christianity is a movement that follows Jesus Christ
* we look to him to state what is to be believed and what is to be done
* we turn to the gospels for reports of Jesus's life and teaching
* those books that Jesus endorsed (OT) must be regarded as further sources for christianity
* if Jesus taught that additional truth was to be revealed, that also is to be examined
