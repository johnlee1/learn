## Summary
The world of the Bible and this present world are very different. It is important to state the gospel message in terms that will be understood in today's world. Many theologians have tried to do this in order to make the message palatable to the modern mind. Some theologians have changed not merely the form of expression, but the substance as well. The goal for contemporizing the Christian message is to retain the content and biblical doctrine while making the message more understandable today. Five criteria are presented to assess the integrity of the message.

## The Challenge of Intelligibility
* one problem of particular concern to the theologian, is the apparent difference between the world of the Bible and the present world. to many persons today, not only the language and concepts, but in some cases the entire frame of reference, seems so sharply different
* the problem, however, is not merely the difference induced by the separation in time from the biblical situation. it is the fact that at the present time, Christianity exists in many diffierent cultures. in many cases, world Christians have seen and adopted dimensions of biblical practice and belief that those in the West have tended to overlook or may ever have distorted, because of their Western orientation. Christians from different cultures, whether from different countries or different subcultures within a given country, need one another, and the Christian message is capable of being expressed in culturally appropriate ways in these different settings. no less urgent than contemporizing is the need for cultural contextualizing

## The Locus of Permanence in Christianity
* to be faithful Christians/theologians, it is essential that we ask the question, What must we retain in order to maintain genuine Christianity, or to remain genuinely Christian. different theologians and segments of Christianity have suggested various answers as to what the abiding element is in Christianity

### An Institution
* most fully enunciated by the Roman Catholic Church
* permanent element in Christianity is institutional

### Acts of God
* answer given in the latter half of the 20th century
* the permanent element of Christianity is certain unique historical events or mighty acts of God, such as the exodus and the "Christ event". it is the acts of God, not biblical accounts, which are the permanent and authoritative element in Christianity

### Experiences
* abiding experiences are the essence, the permanent factor, of Christianity. while doctrinal beliefs may change, people of all periods have the same experiences

### A Way of Life
* it is a way of life, not a set of beliefs, that distinguishes true Christianity and must be preserved
* essence of behavior lies in behavior rather than belief

### Conclusion
* there is also the element of a set of beliefs that are inseparable from this complex of factors. it's only when these elements are joined with an enunciated framework of belief that we can that genuine Christianity is present

## Three Approaches to Contextualizing Theology

### Transplanters
* no effort of contextualizing is necessary. one should simply declare the message as it is stated in biblical form, rather than attempting to restate it in contemporary or local categories. this assumes that there are universal human qualities found in all times and places, and that, consequently, anyone can understand the message. sometimes a theological rationale is given: it is God, and specifically the Holy Spirit, who brings about understanding and conviction. this many be accompanied by a strong emphasis on human depravity, such that the unregenerate person cannot comprehend the truth. there may be a sense that it is presumptuous of the human messenger to attempt to explain things
* difficulties with this approach
    * points of sufficiently great difference between different time periods and cultures as to result in lack of understanding or actual misunderstanding
    * fails to take account of the fact that the message as it is found in the Bible is often already contextualized. many of the statements are directed to particular persons, situations, occasions, or problems. as such, they may not be applicable, at least in that specific form, to different contexts or audiences
    * this approach goes contrary to the practices actually engaged in by biblical speakers and writers. Paul framed his message somewhat differently when speaking ot Jews and to Gentiles
* transplanting = a belief/practice is simply taken from its setting and placed into a new setting, where it is expected to function much as it did in the original context

### Transformers
* world has undergone serious change since biblical times. christianity's beliefs as they stand are so inseparably tied to the ancient worldview that they cannot be maintained independently of it. in other words, the beliefs are the dependent variable, and the broader intellectual milieu, the independent variable. there really is no possibility of retaining the beliefs by merely restating or modernizing them
* most liberals do not really regard the essence of Christianity as bound up with the particular doctrines that were held by ancient believers. consequently, it is not necessary to preserve those doctrines
* humanity has radically changed with the passage of time. whereas at one point the message may have been suitable and helpful to humans in addition to being acceptable to them, they are now so different, their very nature so latered, that the message will fall on unresponsive or even rejecting ears
* since truth is to a large extent considered relative, humanity today is the judge of what is right and wrong. Christian doctrine must change, not humans. "relevance" is the key word, rather than "authoritativeness."
* sources from which the content of Christianity is drawn will thus be considerably broader than in traditional Christianity. not merely some sacred documents of truth, but rather the whole sweep of literature, philosophy, and the sciences is to be consulted in informing the Christian belief

### Translators
* retain the basic content of the message
* put the message ina new form, to speak the language of the hearer
* human is not the measure of what is true
* human, not the message, must be transformed
* make the message intelligible or understandable, dobut do not expect to make it acceptable on contemporary humans' own grounds
* message must challenge contemporary mind-set, not simply accommodate to it
* part of difficulty in contemporizing the message stems from the fact that the biblical revelation came to particular situations. message took on a localized form. the problem is to detect what was imply something to be believed and done in that situation, and what is of more universal application
* additional complication arises from the fact that the BIble does not address fully the issues connected with certain doctrines. in contemporizing the message, are we to limit ourselves to the explicit statements of Scripture, or may we assume that the biblical writers, had they faced the more compelx issues we face, would have said more
* another difficulty stems from the necessity of relating the biblical revelation to our more complete current understanding of the general revelation
* some biblical truths are expressed in forms not meaningful to persons living today
* two steps we must take if our aim is to preserve the essential content but give a contemoprary statement of a biblical teaching: first we must determine what it meant in its original context, and then we must tell what it means today. what is being advocated is a direct translation of meaning from the past situation to the present. this parallels the method of learning a foreign language to which most of us were probably exposed
* not giving a "dynamic equivalent" of the biblical statement. what we are doing instead is giving a new concrete expression to the same lasting truth that was concretely conveyed in biblical times by terms and images that were common then

## Criteria of Permanence
* crucial task of theology will be to identify the timeless truths, the essence of the doctrines, and to separate them from the temporal form in which they were expressed, so that a new form may be created

### Constancy across Cultures
* the temporal, geographical, linguistic, and cultural settings found within the canonical Scriptures vary widely. many centuries intervened between the writing of the first books of the OT and the last books of the NT. geographical and cultural situations range from a pastoral setting in ancient Palestine to the urban setting of imperial Rome. there are differences between Hebrew and Greek culture and language, which, although sometimes exaggerated, are nonetheless very real
* if, then, there is a constancy of biblical teaching across several settings, we may well be in possession of a genuine cultural constant or the essence of the doctrine. variations may be thought of as part of the form of the doctrine
* e.g. centrality of belief in Jesus Christ - spans any gap between Jew and Gentile, Peter preached it at Pentecost in Jerusalem to Jews from various cultures. Paul declared it in a gentile setting to the Philippian jailer

### Universal Setting
* note what elements are put forth in a universal fashion
* e.g. baptism in great commission - baptism not merely an isolated phenomenon, localized at one time and place, but it is of permanent applicability
* e.g. not foot washing - there is reason to believe that his example was not necessarily to be extended universally in this precise form

### A Recognized Permanent Factor as a Base
* a particular teaching based on a recognized permanent factor may itself be permanent
* e.g. priesthood of all believers based on the fact that our great High Priest has once for all "gone through the heavens" and is a priest forever

### Indissoluble Link with an Experience Regarded as Essential
* whenever our experience proves to be real and permanent, we can be assured that the biblical doctrine on which it is dependent is permanent as well

### Final Position within Progressive Revelation
* if we understand God to have worked in a process of accomplishing redemption for humanity, revealing himself and his plan gradually, we will weight later developments more heavily than earlier ones. the assumption is that we have transient or anticipative forms in the earlier cases, and that the latest case is the final form

## Objections to This Approach to Contextualizing
* some say culture should do more than merely guide the form; it should actually contribute to the content itself
    * conflicts with an early position of the church that there is a fixed body of tradition
    * numerous passages have no hint of any anticipation that there would be later additions to the content of the faith. it was assumed that there was a finality to what they had received
    * it may be that later culture should add to the faith. if so, however, this very concept is different from the understanding in biblical times, and in the earliest centuries of the church
* some say shouldn't principlize as a means to contemporize the faith. it substitutes something else for the bible itself, in this case, certain principles that are thought to stand behind the text. principles tend to be quite general. the search for timeless truths ignores the conditioned nature of hte interpreter, resulting in the interpreter's cultural biases beind read into the process
    * the idea that this substitutes something else for the Scriptures themselves is fallacious. it would only apply if the principle were something foreign to the Scripture
