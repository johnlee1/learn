## Summary
In modern times, biblical study has been challenged by a variety of criticla methodologies. This critical study of the BIble began with historical and textual criticism of the authorship of the books of the Bible. In the 19th/20th centuries, what came to be categorized as higher criticism developed. Four recent influential types include form criticism, redaction criticism, reader-response criticism, and canonical criticism. Although biblical-critical methods may be usedful tools to study of the Bible, if they are based on natural presuppositions instead of supernatural ones, they can result in a misunderstanding of the biblical message. A second concern is how adequately religious language expresses that message. Religious languages often transcends sensory experience. To the modern mind, which seeks empirical verification, this kind of language may seem unsatisfactory. It is true that religious language may not be subject to direct verificaiton, but religious language can be cognitively meaningful, through a broad system of synthesis. 

## The Nature of Biblical Criticsm
1. Textual criticism is the attempt to determine the original text of the biblical books, by comparing the various extant manuscripts
2. Literary-source criticism is the effort to identify the various literary sources on which books of the bible are based or from which they derive.
3. Form criticism is the endeavor to get behind the written sources of the bible to the period of oral tradition, and to isolate the oral froms that went into the written sources. insofar as this attempts to trace the history of the tradition, it is known as tradition criticism
4. Redaction criticism is a study of the activity of the biblical authors in shaping, modifying, or even creating material for the final product that they wrote
5. Historical criticism in a sense employs all of the above and draws on the data of archaeology and of nonbilical historical sources. it has as its aim the determination of the authorship and date of hte biblical books, and the establishment and interpretation of what actually occurred historically
6. Comparative-religions criticism assumes that all religions follow certain common patterns of development. It explains the history of the Judeo-Christian faith in terms of these patterns. a common assumption in this endeavor is that religions develop from polytheism to monotheism
7. Structural criticism attempts to investigate the relationship between the surface structure of the writing and the deeper implicit structures that belong to literature as such. these implicit structures are the formal literary possibilities with which the author must work
8. Reader-response criticism regards the locus of meaning not as the text, but the reader. the reader creates the meaning, rather than finding it there. consequently, attention is concentrated on the reader rather than the text

### Form Criticism
* get bhind the written sources to determine the growth of the tradition in the preliterary or oral period

#### Background
* by 1900, source critics had reached something of a consensus regarding the gospels. Mark was believed to have been written first, and Matthew and Luke were thought to have depended in their writing on Mark and another source referred to as "Q", believed to have been made up, to a large extent, of Jesus's sayings. in addition, Matthew and LUke were each thought to have relied on an independent source of material unique to the particular gospel. initially referred to as special Matthew and special Luke
* there was a growing conviction, however, that behind these written documents were oral traditions. form criticism represented an attempt to get at these oral forms and trace the history of their development.

#### Axioms of Form Criticism
* Jesus's stories and sayings were first circulated in small, independent units. on careful examination, the chronological and geographical transitions between many of the stories in the gospels are seen to be vague, and are assumed to be the work of an editor trying to fit the stories together in some osrt of coherent form. the gospels also present some of the same incidents in different settings. this bears out the view that the evangelists had stories before them "like a heap of unstrung pearls" that they strung together in a way that seemed to make good sense
* these self-contained units or elements of material found in the Gospels can be classified according to their literary forms. this tenet is based on the observation that the oral traditions and literary works of primitive cultures follow comparatively fixed patterns and occur in a few definite styles. there are the sayings (parables, proverbs, prophetic/apocalyptic utterances, legal prescriptions, and "I" words) and also stories ("Apothegm stories" provide a historical setting for a saying or pronouncement of Jesus, miracle stories, legends resemble the tales or fragments of tales concerning saints or holy mena and women in both christian and non-christian traditions, myths are literary devices used to convey a supernatural or transcendent truth in earthly form)
* once classified, the various units of Gospel material can be stratified, or arranged in terms of their relative ages. from this, the historical value of various types of Gospel untis can be determined. the earlier the material, the more historically reliable or authentic it is. if we know the general processes and paterns that oral traditions follow, it will be possible to ascertain at what stage a certain element is likely to have entered. this is particularly true if we know at what time specific influences were present in the community preserving and transmitting the tradition. 
    * the parables themselves are likelier to go back to Jesus's own sayings than are the explanations and moralizing applications, which probably represent the work of the church serving as interpreter
    * some miracles (healing and exorcisms) are considered typically "Jewish," and therefore from an early period of the church. the so-called nature miracles, such as the stilling of the waters and teh cursing of hte fig tree, reflect the HEllenistic interest of a later period. arising from the earlier period, the former are likelier to be authentic than are the nature miracles
* the setting in life of the early church can be determined. a careful study of hte gospels will reveal t us the problems faced by the early church, affecting the form of hte tradition. specific words of Jesus were preserved in order to deal with the needs of the church. in some cases sayings may even have been created and attributed to him for this purpose. what we have therefore in the gospels is not so much what Jesus said and did, as what the church preached about him. most critics considered the gospels more like sales/promotional literature than like carefully controlled research bulletins

#### Values of Form Criticism
* form criticism has pointed out the vital connection between the incorporation of Jesus's deeds and words into the Gospel accounts and the faith and life of his followers. the gospel writers were not concerned to dwell on aspects of Jesus's life and sayings that were not significant for faith
* form critics have pointed out that the gospels are products of the group of believers. the gospels reflect the sort of well-balanced judgement that is possible when one's ideas are subjected to the scrutiny of others, rather than merely private interpretation
* form criticism points out that we are able to learn a considerable amount about the early church and the situations it was facing from the material the gospel writers chose to include or emphasize
* form criticism, when its presuppositions are not contrary to the perspectives and positions of the biblical authors, is able to help confirm some of the basic assertions of scripture

#### Criticism of Form Criticism
* there seems to be an implicit assumption that the early christians, or those who preserved the traditions and reduced them to writing, were not too interested in history. on the contrary, these were people to whom historical events were very important
* form criticism assumes that the gospel writers were not persons of historical ability and dependability. problems with this:
    * assumes that the data about the occurrences were not available. this, however, fails to take account of the eyewitnesses who helped form and preserve the tradition
    * these were men who would place a high value on veracity. in their background, tradition was very important, and that, being Jewish, they were possessed of a conservative mentatlity. nor should the tenacity of the Oriental memory be forgotten
    * in view of what these men proved themselves willing to do and suffer for the sake of what they proclaimed as true, the possibility of intentional falsification is not a tenable suggestion
* the effort to stratify the forms tends to break down. the entire system depends on this step, yet there are some forms that defy such analysis, and at other points considerable artificiality enters this endeavor. assumes that a similarity of style indicates a common origin, but this is subjective. and the assumption that the miracle stories are largely late additions, and that explicit Christology arose first in the church rather than in teaching of Christ have not yet been sufficiently justified to warrant the extent to which they govern the method
* the Sitz im Lebend is regarded as the explanation for the inclusion or even creation of many items. but comparing the gospels with the known Sitz im Leben of the church at certain points in its early period yields some strange findings. on on hand, some matters that we would expect to find Jesus addressing are not present. conversely, some matters are present that we would not expect the church to have included. the other possibility is that inclusion/omission were determined not by the Sitz im Leben, but by the concern of the writesr and of hte transmitters of the tradition for a reliable and historically accurate document
* form criticism apparently regards uniqueness as the criterion of authenticity. a saying cannot be considered an authentic word of Jesus if there are parallels in the rabbinical records or the life of the early church. but such a standard of authenticity would not be countenanced by historical critics working in other fields
* form criticism seems to make little allowance for the possibility of inspiration. rather, the process was governed by the immanent laws that control the formation of all oral traditions, and the writer was limited to received materials. this theory allows no room for the active direction/guidance by the Holy Spirit in the process of formation of the oral tradition
* the possibility that some of the eyewitnesses may have made written records of what they had just observed is ignored

### Redaction Criticism

#### Development and Nature of the Discipline
* redaction criticism is an attempt to move beyond the findings of literary-source, form, and tradition criticism, using the insights gathered from them. it rests on the assumption that the gospels grew out of a theological concern that each of the gospel writers had. these authors were, in a real sense, more theologians than historians
* redaction critics view the synoptic writers as self-conscious theologians, including, expanding, compressing, omitting, and even creating material for their account in keeping with their theological purposes. in a sense, this makes the author simply the last stage in the process of the development of the tradition. thus it has become customary to speak of three Sitze im Leben: (1) the original situation in which Jesus spoke and acted, (2) the situation faced by the early church in the conduct of its ministry, and (3) the situation of the gospel writer in his work and purpose
* assumes that the evangelists were not geratly concerned about what Jesus said and did. the gospel writers are regarded as saying those things that served their purposes. presupposes that the burden of proof lies on the person who assumes the reported words are authentic words of Jesus. faith becomes a faith, not in the Jesus who was, but in the Jesus who was believed in, and in whom the evangelists want us to believe
* criteria (functional and linguistic factors) for passages considered redactional
    * explain, interpret, or otherwise comment on the accompanying material
    * provide condensed summaries of some general feature of Jesus's preaching, teaching, healing, or fame
    * foreshadow or anticipate events to be related later in the gospel
    * introduce collections of sayings or narrative material
    * provide brief indications of time, place, or circumstance
    * significant linguistic phenomenona occurring often in one gospel but seldom or never in the others may be a sign of redactional origin

#### Criticisms of Redaction Criticism
* seems to credit the evangelists with a remarkable refinement of theological purpose/method. but it seems unlikely that they had this amount of ingenuity/creativity
* the search for the Litz im Leben has a tendency to assume that everything in the gospels or even the entire NT is said with a particular audience and a particular issue in view. while this is true of much of the NT, it is highly questionable that all of it should be so regarded
* the force of linguistic or stylistic criteria varies greatly. to conclude that a certain phrase is redactional because it occurs four times in Luke/Acts but not in the other gospels is unwarranted
* it is sometimes assumed that the theology of the author can be determined from the editorial passages alone. but the traditional material is in many respects just as significant for this purpose, since the editor did choose to include it, after all
* redaction criticism limits itself to the investigation of the evangelists' situation/purpose. it does not raise questions about the historicity of the material recorded in their works. it was the present experience with the risen Lord that motivated the evangelists

#### Values of Redaction Criticism 
* sound redaction criticism can help rebut the destructive use of critical tools and substantiate the veracity of the text
* the delineating of redactional emphases aids the scholar in determining the particular emphases of the evangelists
* use of the redactional tools help answer synoptic problems
* by observing how a given evangelist adapted and applied the material he had received, we can gain insight into how the message of Christ can be adapted to new situations that we encounter
* the evangelists' activity, then, included interpreation. they were taking Jesus's statements and paraphrasing them, expanding them, condensing them. they were, however, remaining true to Jesus's original teaching. we do not have exactly the words that Jesus spoke, but we do have the substance of what he said

### Structural Criticism
* structural exegesis primarily concerns itself with deep structures, the constraints that impose themselves on any author or speaker. two types: narrative structures and mythical structures. the mythical structure as a whole interrelates the various mythemes
* structuralism has proved not to be a basically stable view. it has yielded to successors in two directions: semiotic and reader-response criticism
* shortcomings:
    * there has been a turning from confidence in the human subject, hastened at least in part by post-Freudian psychoanalytic approaches to the text, which heighten the capacity of the self for self-deception
    * there has been a lack of clarity regarding what would count as verification of the results of this procedure, as well as questions about the usefulness of the results, relative to the amount of effort invested in the structuralist endeavor
    * there has been so much modification of the earlier objectivist ideas of structure that it is questionable how appropriate the designation of structuralism is for the later work

### Reader-Response Criticism
* structuralism was an approach of mutuality between the text and the reader. each was expected to transform the other
* reader-response criticism: reader over the text. postmodern reading styles emphasize indeterminancy, the production of meaning by the reader, and, in many cases, the refusal to appeal to consensual criteria in order to adjudicate between different readings
* against the idea that meaning is embedded in the text and that the task of the reader is to extract it. objectifying factor: an individual reader is not free to find just anything within the text, being constrained bvy the community of which the reader is a part
* the interests of the reader affect the understanding of what the text says. rather than asking how this may be neutralized or reduced, however, these interpreters work from that diversity as a given and shift the very locus of meaning
* problems:
    * question of meaning should apply not only to the biblical text, but to all texts, including the reader-response critic's discussion of meaning and the biblical text
    * this approach seems to divide theories of meaning into either formalist or contextual-pragmatic. don't have to go to either extremes
    * the appeal to communities does nto solve the seemingly inherent tendencies to subjectivism. the community is merely a larger version of the individual
    * if taken seriously, this philosophy could never be more than a narrative philosophy, telling the story of a particular philosophical tradition. in theory, this approach is merely one story among many. yet, there is a rejection of other stories of a more definitive or restrictive nature

### Canonical Criticism
* rejects utility or final authority of the results of criticism. the final form of the text gives a fuller theological meaning than would be found by examining simply the view found in any of its sources
* approach has not met with widespread acceptance among OT thinkers. it is of value, however, for pointing out that the basic purpose of Scripture was the life of the church, and that standard critical study in itself leaves the Scripture a document of interest primairly to scholars somewhat abstracted from life

### Guidelines for Evaluating Citical Methods
* be on guard against assumptions that are antisupernatural in import
* detect the presence of circular reasoning
* watchful for unwarranted inferences
* be aware of arbitrariness and subjectivity
* alert to the presence of assumptions regarding an antiethical relationship between faith and reason
* in all these matters, we are dealing with probability rather than certainty, and that where probabilities build on one another, there is a cumalative effecton the conclusion

## The Study of Theological Language

### Theological Language and Verificational Analysis
* early 20th century, movement known as logical positivism focused on the meaning of meaning
* observed that there are two basic types of cognitive propositions
    * analytic statements, such as 2+2=4, in which the predicate is contained, by definition, within the subject of the sentence. such mathematical-type statements are necessarily true, but they are uninformative rewgarding the empirical world
        * e.g. "all bachelors are unmarried"
    * synthetic statements, in which there is something in the predicate that was not contained within the subject. the trueth or falsity of such a statement can be determined only by an examination of the real world
        * e.g. "all bachelors are tall"
* analytic statements are meaningful because they define terms. synthetic statements, according to logical positivism, are meaningful because there is a set of sense data that will verify or falsify them
* virtually discarded many traditional uses of language despite the fact that those who employed ethical/religious language found them serviceable and highly meaningful. another very basic/serious problem concerned the status of the verifiability principle. this seemed not to be ananalytic statement, but also no empirical considerations seemt o count for or against it. philosophers concluded that logical positivism in its original form had to be abandoned or greatly modified

### Theological Language and Functional Analysis
* functional analysis attempts to describe how language actually is used
* "language games" have rules and problems arise when these rules are violated, or when one slips from one form of language game into anther without realizing it, or tries to apply the rules of one game to another.
    * treating theological language about divine creation as a statement about the empirical origin of the universe is a switch from one language game to another, from theological language to empirical language

### Answers to the Accusation of Meaninglessness

#### Theological Language as Personal Language (not promising)
* religious/theological language follows the pattern of personal language. there is overlap between our language about God and our language about other persons. when apply this model of the personal-language game to understanding of the nature/function of theological language, turns to revelation. just as we know persons only as they reveal themselves, so the personal God is known only through his revelation of himself
* problem: analogy of language about God and about human persons breaks down, because we have sensory experience of the latter, but not of the former. just how our language derives from the relationship with God is unclear

#### Theological Language as Eschatological Verification (not promising)
* although we do not currently have verification of our theological propositions, we will one day
* problems: just what does it mean to speak of this eschatological occurrence as empirical? in what way will we have sensory experience of God in the future, if we do not now?

#### Theological Language as Metaphysical Synthesis (more promising)
* religious propositions are cognitively meaningful as signs of a metaphysical synthesis
* sign - unit of language that compose the synthesis
* semantics - relationship between the sign and its referent
* syntatics - relationship among the several signs in the system
* interpretics - relationship between the sign and the interpreter
* internal criteria (syntatic dimension, the relationships among the signs)
    * consistency - the absence of logical contradiction among the symbols in the system
    * coherence - genuine unity, an interrelatedness among the components of the system
* external criteria
    * applicability - capable of illuminating some experience naturally and without distortion
    * adequacy - capable of accounting for all possible experience
* the meaning of a fact is related to the syte o finterpretation within which it is placed, it will not always be possible to establish the meaning of each symbol individually in isolation from the system, or to verify each proposition independently. but to the extent that the whole is shown to be meaningful and each proposition coheres with the whole, each of the parts is also meaningful
* criticism: assumes certain universally accepted, or objective criteria. it is not possible to find any neutral, nonperspective point from which to make such an assessment. 
    * response: in practice, even on a prereflective level, these sorts of criteria are rather widely employed by those who care about truth issues. the language of Christian theology is cognitively meaningful, for its truth status is that of a metaphysical system. its truthfulness can be tested by the application of the several types of criteria

#### Theological Language as a Means to Discernment and Commitment (more promising)
* two levels of meaning:
    * empirical reference that lies on the surface and is quickly understood
    * deeper meaning that is also objectively there, but must be drawn out
* language that has an obvious empirical referent also signifies an objective situation, which is not so apparent (e.g. new birth)
* if written language successfully accomplishes the author's purposes, it will evoke a discernment of this "something more." yet the something more was always objetively present. religious language will commit whatever category transgressions are necessary to convey the meaning that cannot simply be unpacked by an exegesis of the literal meaning
    * thus, in referring to the trinity, one may find it helpful to utilize faulty grammar (e.g. "He are three", "they is one")
    * or one may use riddles, puns, analogies, illustrations, all of which will "nibble at the edges," as it were, of the deeper, fuller meaning, in the hope that discernment will occur
* discernment should be attributed to the illuminating work of the Holy Spirit. the goal of religious language is not merely discernment. it is also intended to elicit commitment

#### Summary
* we have rejected the narrow criterion of meaningfulness proposed by logical positivism. we have, however, maintained that although knowledge is not gained exclusively through sense experience (there is such a thing as direct revelation from God to human beings), its meaning is grasped on an empirical basis. meaning is found in symbols that on the surface refer to sense experiences. but the meanings of theological language goes beyond anything literal in those symbols. while meaning is objevtively present in the symbols, it must be discerned. it cannot be extracted by a strictly scientific method. and yet, the propositions of religious language are cognitively meaningful, not as isolated staements of fact concerning sense experience, but as parts of a broad metaphysical synthesis

### Speech-Act Theory
* John Austin - speech-acts classified into three groups:
    * Locutionary: roughly equivalent to uttering a certain sentence with a certain sense and reference, which again is roughly equivalent to 'meaning' in the traditional sense
    * Illouctionary: acts such as informing, ordering, warning, undertaking, etc., i.e., utterances which have a certain (conventional) force
    * Perlocutionary: what we bring about or achieve by saying something ,such as convincing, persuading, deterring
* John Searle - speech-acts classified into three groups:
    * Utterance acts: uttering words
    * Propositional acts: referring, predicating
    * Illouctionary acts: stating, questioning, commanding, promising, and the like
* Kevin Vanhoozer - analyzes speech-acts in terms of four factors
    * Proposition - Fact - Issue
    * Purpose - Function - Intention
    * Presence - Form - Incarnation
    * Power - Force - Illouction
* This means the following:
    * every text is about something, proposes something, for consideration
    * there is usually an intention to communicate something
    * an author then seeks to express this in a form appropriate to his or her purpose
    * the power or force of the text depends on these three preceding factors
