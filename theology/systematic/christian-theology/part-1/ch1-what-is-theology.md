## Summary
Theology in a Christian context is a discipline of study that seeks to understand the God revealed in the Bible and to provide a Christian understanding of reality. It seeks to understand God's creation, particularly human beings and their condition, and God's redemptive work in relation to humankind. Biblical, historical, and philosophical theology provide insights and understandings that help lead toward a coherent whole. Theology has practical value in providing guidance for the Christian life and ministry.

## The Nature of Religion
* religion is belief or doctrine, feeling or attitudes, and a  way of life or manner of behaving
* the actual living-out and personal practice of religion occur on the level of primary experience
* there is also a level of reflection on what is occurring on the primary level. the discipline that concerns itself with describing, analyzing, criticizing, and organizing the doctrines is theology
* theology is a second-level activity as contrasted with religion. it is to religion what psychology is to human emotions, what aesthetics is to works of art, what political science is to political behavior
* other concepts of religion and of doctrine
    * pragmatic view: religion consists primarily of its doctrinal teachings in propositional form. religion is clearly pragmatic, concerned with alleviating the injustices within the human race. the role of doctrine is to speak to those inequities. theology becomes critical reflection on praxis.
    * subjective view: religion is an expression of emotional experience. essence of religion is an experience of the one great reality. doctrine are the differing interpretations various groups of people place on this generic experience as they interpret it through the grid of their own culture
    * cultural-linguistic view: religion is a set of categories or teachings that each culture constructs to interpret life and on the basis of which its members function. it does not grow out of experience so much as it shapes it. it is a story, told by its adherents, on the basis of which they make sense of life. doctrines is a second-level activity that serves a regulative function. rather than giving us ontological knowledge about God, doctrines are rules governing the community
* christian view of religion
    * doctrines consist of genuine knowledge about God
    * religion involves the whole person: intellect, emotions, and will
    * two major advantages of this view not possessed by other views
        * enables us to account for the full richness and complexity of human religions
        * fits more closely the actual understanding of religion and doctrine with which the early church and the authors of Scripture work
        * fits the average Christian's understanding and practice of the Christian life
        * other dimensions of Christian experience, such as the ethical application of Christian teachings and the wholehearted praise of God involved in worship, are intimately tied to our doctrinal udnerstanding. but they are complementary, not alternatives to it

## The Definition of Theology
* theology is the discipline that strives to give a coherent statement of the doctrines of the Christian faith, based primarily on the Scriptures, placed in the context of culture in general, worded in a contemporary idiom, and related to issues of life
* five key aspects of the task of theology
    * theology is biblical: primary source of its content the canonical Scriptures of the OT & NT
    * theology is systematic: draws on the entire bible. relate the various portions to one antoher to coalesce the varied teachings into some type of harmonious/coherent whole
    * theology relates to the issues of general culture and learning: for example, it attempts to relate its view of origins to the concepts advanced by science, its view of human nature to psychology's understanding of personality, its conception of providence to the work of philosophy of history, and so on
    * theology is contemporary: while it treats timeless issues, it must use language, concepts, and thought forms that make some sense in the context of hte present time
    * theology is practical: theology relates to living rather than merely to belief. the Christian faith gives us help with our practical concerns
