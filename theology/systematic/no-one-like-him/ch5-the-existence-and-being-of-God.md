## Introduction to Theistic Proofs
* philosophy
    * impossible to prove God's existence, but deemed belief in God necessary, anyway
    * none of the traditional theistic proofs issound, but we must postualte God's existence anyway. without it, there seems to be no ultimate grounding for morality
    * God's existence can't be proved by traditional arguments, but that doesn't destroy theism. theists can claim to know God exists by some noncognitive means, such as personal experience
    * belief in God does not rest on argument/evidence, nor need it do so in order for them to be within their epistemic rights in holding such a belief. rather, for those believers, belief in God is properly basic and thoroughly rational, even if they haven't marshaled any evidence/argument for their belief
* theology
    * the theistic argument will convince no one who isn't already a believer, but for believers, these proofs offer grounds for thinking that their faith is not utterly irrational
    * one or more of the arguments is successful
    * rational arguments for God are irrelevant. for those who have experienced God in a revelatory encounter, what possible rational argument could wrest from them their belief in God? the truth and living God is not some static proposition that comes at the end of a demonstrative proof; he is the dynamic, living God of the universe! as for nonbelievers, it is equally dubious that a rational argument will convince them of God's existence
* traditional arguments for God's existence are either a priori or a posteriori. a posteriori - appeals to some feature about the universe as a basis for arguing to God. a priori - does not do that. instead, if one understands the concepts used in the argument, one can decide whether the argument is true or false apart from any empirical investigation. a true a p riori argument is absolutely certain, whereas the premises and conclusion of an a posteriori argument are at best 99% probable. the ontological argument is the only one of the traditional proofs that is an a priori argument. 
    * a posteriori
        * some, like the cosmological argument, move from some fact about the world to a conclusion that purportedly follows inevitably from the premises of the argument. while the fat about the world is at best highly probable, nonetheless, if one grants it, some conclusion follows inevitably from it
        * many a posteriori arguments are intentionally probabilistic in form. appeal is made to some empirical fact, and various explanations of that fact are offered. one particular explanation is then deemed most probably true. teleological and moral arguments typically follow this form

## The Ontological Argument

### Anselm I
* The idea of God as the greatest conceivable being (GCB) is in everyone's understanding, but that, of course, commits no one to belief in God's existence in reality. Anselm thinks it should, however, for if we really understand what it means to be the GCB, we should immediately see that a being which exists both in the understanding and in reality is greater tahn a being who exists only in the understanding. so God, the GCB, exists

### Criticisms of Anselm I
* conceivability of something doesn't guarantee its existence
    * Anselm reply is that this is not true for an infinite, necessary being
* Immanuel Kant
    * 1) according to the ontological argument, the statement "the GCB exists" is analytics. an analytic statement is one whose predicate term is contained in the subject term. that is, if one understands the meaning of the subject term ("GCB") and the predicate term ("exists"), one immediately sees whether what is said is true, for the meaning of the subject term either does or does not contain the meaning of hte predicate. the ontological argument maintains that if one understands the meaning of "God," one must immediately understand that God exists. Kant complained that all claims about something's existence are synthetic, not analytics. a synthetic statement is one whose predicate concept is not contained in its subject concept. by understanding the meaning of hte subject term, one does not automatically know whether what is said about it (the predicate) is true; one must investigate
    * 2) existence is not a perfection. the ontological argument assumes that it is, but it isn't
    * 3) existence is not a predicate. once one describes the nature of God, to add that he exists adds nothing to the description of his nature. instead, it merely asserts that the definition applies to something actual in the world

### Anselm II
* we can think of a being who can be conceived not to exist, and we can also conceive of a being who cannot be conceived not to exist. in philosophical terminology, the former is a contingent being and the latter is a necessary being. something contingent depends on something other than itself for existence and hence must be brought into existence. a necessary being depends on nothing but itself and cannot go out of existence. Anselm reasons that if God is the GCB, he cannot be contingent, since then he wouldn't be the GCB, for a necessary being surely greater than a contingent one. so, a proper understanding of God as the GCB should convince us that God must exist and must do so as a necessary being. while contingent beings are not actual just because someone conceives of them, that is not so for God. in Anselm I, existence is considered a perfection, but in Anselm II necessary existence is the perfection

### Interaction with Anselm II
* John Hick believes that a major problem with Anselm II is that it tells us what kind of existence God must have if he exists, but offers no proof of his existence. that is, what Anselm actually proved is that a contingent being could not be God. any being worth of the title "God" must be a necessary being, for necessary existence is surely greater than contingent existence. but none of this establishes that in fact there is such a being
