## Introduction to Theistic Proofs
* philosophy
    * impossible to prove God's existence, but deemed belief in God necessary, anyway
    * none of the traditional theistic proofs issound, but we must postualte God's existence anyway. without it, there seems to be no ultimate grounding for morality
    * God's existence can't be proved by traditional arguments, but that doesn't destroy theism. theists can claim to know God exists by some noncognitive means, such as personal experience
    * belief in God does not rest on argument/evidence, nor need it do so in order for them to be within their epistemic rights in holding such a belief. rather, for those believers, belief in God is properly basic and thoroughly rational, even if they haven't marshaled any evidence/argument for their belief
* theology
    * the theistic argument will convince no one who isn't already a believer, but for believers, these proofs offer grounds for thinking that their faith is not utterly irrational
    * one or more of the arguments is successful
    * rational arguments for God are irrelevant. for those who have experienced God in a revelatory encounter, what possible rational argument could wrest from them their belief in God? the truth and living God is not some static proposition that comes at the end of a demonstrative proof; he is the dynamic, living God of the universe! as for nonbelievers, it is equally dubious that a rational argument will convince them of God's existence
* traditional arguments for God's existence are either a priori or a posteriori. a posteriori - appeals to some feature about the universe as a basis for arguing to God. a priori - does not do that. instead, if one understands the concepts used in the argument, one can decide whether the argument is true or false apart from any empirical investigation. a true a p riori argument is absolutely certain, whereas the premises and conclusion of an a posteriori argument are at best 99% probable. the ontological argument is the only one of the traditional proofs that is an a priori argument. 
    * a posteriori
        * some, like the cosmological argument, move from some fact about the world to a conclusion that purportedly follows inevitably from the premises of the argument. while the fat about the world is at best highly probable, nonetheless, if one grants it, some conclusion follows inevitably from it
        * many a posteriori arguments are intentionally probabilistic in form. appeal is made to some empirical fact, and various explanations of that fact are offered. one particular explanation is then deemed most probably true. teleological and moral arguments typically follow this form
