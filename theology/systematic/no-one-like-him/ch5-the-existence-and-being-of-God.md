## Introduction to Theistic Proofs
* philosophy
    * impossible to prove God's existence, but deemed belief in God necessary, anyway
    * none of the traditional theistic proofs issound, but we must postualte God's existence anyway. without it, there seems to be no ultimate grounding for morality
    * God's existence can't be proved by traditional arguments, but that doesn't destroy theism. theists can claim to know God exists by some noncognitive means, such as personal experience
    * belief in God does not rest on argument/evidence, nor need it do so in order for them to be within their epistemic rights in holding such a belief. rather, for those believers, belief in God is properly basic and thoroughly rational, even if they haven't marshaled any evidence/argument for their belief
* theology
    * the theistic argument will convince no one who isn't already a believer, but for believers, these proofs offer grounds for thinking that their faith is not utterly irrational
    * one or more of the arguments is successful
    * rational arguments for God are irrelevant. for those who have experienced God in a revelatory encounter, what possible rational argument could wrest from them their belief in God? the truth and living God is not some static proposition that comes at the end of a demonstrative proof; he is the dynamic, living God of the universe! as for nonbelievers, it is equally dubious that a rational argument will convince them of God's existence
* traditional arguments for God's existence are either a priori or a posteriori. a posteriori - appeals to some feature about the universe as a basis for arguing to God. a priori - does not do that. instead, if one understands the concepts used in the argument, one can decide whether the argument is true or false apart from any empirical investigation. a true a p riori argument is absolutely certain, whereas the premises and conclusion of an a posteriori argument are at best 99% probable. the ontological argument is the only one of the traditional proofs that is an a priori argument. 
    * a posteriori
        * some, like the cosmological argument, move from some fact about the world to a conclusion that purportedly follows inevitably from the premises of the argument. while the fat about the world is at best highly probable, nonetheless, if one grants it, some conclusion follows inevitably from it
        * many a posteriori arguments are intentionally probabilistic in form. appeal is made to some empirical fact, and various explanations of that fact are offered. one particular explanation is then deemed most probably true. teleological and moral arguments typically follow this form

## The Ontological Argument

### Anselm I
* The idea of God as the greatest conceivable being (GCB) is in everyone's understanding, but that, of course, commits no one to belief in God's existence in reality. Anselm thinks it should, however, for if we really understand what it means to be the GCB, we should immediately see that a being which exists both in the understanding and in reality is greater tahn a being who exists only in the understanding. so God, the GCB, exists

### Criticisms of Anselm I
* conceivability of something doesn't guarantee its existence
    * Anselm reply is that this is not true for an infinite, necessary being
* Immanuel Kant
    * 1) according to the ontological argument, the statement "the GCB exists" is analytics. an analytic statement is one whose predicate term is contained in the subject term. that is, if one understands the meaning of the subject term ("GCB") and the predicate term ("exists"), one immediately sees whether what is said is true, for the meaning of the subject term either does or does not contain the meaning of hte predicate. the ontological argument maintains that if one understands the meaning of "God," one must immediately understand that God exists. Kant complained that all claims about something's existence are synthetic, not analytics. a synthetic statement is one whose predicate concept is not contained in its subject concept. by understanding the meaning of hte subject term, one does not automatically know whether what is said about it (the predicate) is true; one must investigate
    * 2) existence is not a perfection. the ontological argument assumes that it is, but it isn't
    * 3) existence is not a predicate. once one describes the nature of God, to add that he exists adds nothing to the description of his nature. instead, it merely asserts that the definition applies to something actual in the world

### Anselm II
* we can think of a being who can be conceived not to exist, and we can also conceive of a being who cannot be conceived not to exist. in philosophical terminology, the former is a contingent being and the latter is a necessary being. something contingent depends on something other than itself for existence and hence must be brought into existence. a necessary being depends on nothing but itself and cannot go out of existence. Anselm reasons that if God is the GCB, he cannot be contingent, since then he wouldn't be the GCB, for a necessary being surely greater than a contingent one. so, a proper understanding of God as the GCB should convince us that God must exist and must do so as a necessary being. while contingent beings are not actual just because someone conceives of them, that is not so for God. in Anselm I, existence is considered a perfection, but in Anselm II necessary existence is the perfection

### Interaction with Anselm II
* John Hick believes that a major problem with Anselm II is that it tells us what kind of existence God must have if he exists, but offers no proof of his existence. that is, what Anselm actually proved is that a contingent being could not be God. any being worth of the title "God" must be a necessary being, for necessary existence is surely greater than contingent existence. but none of this establishes that in fact there is such a being

## The Cosmological Argument

### Casual Arguments

#### Aquinas's First Way
* some things in our world are in motion or changing. but if something is in the process of changing to another state, it is potentially in that state but not actually there. it is impossible for the same thing to be in teh state of actuality and potentiality in the same respect. whatever moves from the state of potentiality to actuality cannot move itself; it must be moved by something already in the state of actuality. however, whatever changes something else is itself changed, but there cannot be an infinite regress of movers or changers, for then there would be no first mover, and, consequently, no other mover, since subsequent movers move only inasmuch as they are moved by the first mover. thus, there must be a first mover, and he is God
* objection: if one thing causes another to change, the mover must actually be in the state toward which the changing object moves
* objection: things are as a brute fact in motion is not impossible. it is also possible that things in motion have been in motion eternally, so they never began to change
* objection: why can there not be an infinite regress of changers?
* objection: why God is the unchanged changer?

### Contingency Arguments
* principle of sufficient reason, according to which nothing ever happens without a sufficient reason why it occurs rather than something else. hence, everything that happens is explainable, at least in principle. in our world, we see nothing but contingent beings. of course, whatever is contingent owes its reason for existence to something else. the problem is that if everything is contingent, then everything owes its reason for existence to something else; we need a sufficient reason outside the series of contingent objects to have a sufficient reason for the existence of the whole. what is required is a being which depends on nothing but itself, and thus needs no further explanation than itself to explain why it exists. that means there must be a necessary being (one who causes his own existence) if we are to find a sufficient reason and explanation as to why the world as a whole exists. that necessary being is God
* objection: matter is eternal, how can God cause his own existence, we don't use necessary being to explain other historical events (we don't go back that far), scientists deem it true that everything has a cause which explains it for whatever happens but not in regard to whatever exists (science doesn't show this), some things are just brute facts

### Swinburne's Inductive Argument
* the probability that our universe should exist as a result of creation by God is greater than the probability that it should exist of itself
* objection: 
    * why? the universe's existence could be an inexplicable brute fact. 
    * the God-hypothesis necessitates that a non-embodied being has intentions about creating a world and accomplishes them, though he has no material parts to his being that would allow him to do anything in ways creatures normally do things. given our lack of experience of non-embodied beings, it is highly improbable, that any should exist, let alone create a world

## Teleological Argument

### William Paley: The Watch and the Watchmaker
* if he found a watch, watch has various parts that have been put together for a purpose. its parts move so as to indicate the hour of the day. having observed the various mechanisms in the watch, we must conclude that it had a maker who understood its construction and designed its use. we would conclude this even if we had never seen a watch made, even if the watch didn't always function properly, even if we couldn't discover the function of some of the watch's parts. no one would think there was a principle of order inherent in things that automatically caused the pieces of the watch to come together. suppose we found that the watch had the ability to manufacture other watches so that the watch itself was probably produced by a previous watch. that still wouldn't cause us to question the design of the watch. instead, we would marvel at the intelligence that produced the original watch in such a way as to allow the production of further watches
* apply this line of reasoning to the world. by analogy, we can see that nature gives evidences of design and purpose just as the watch does. various organisms and organs are fitted together so that creatures can survive. as evidences of design in teh watch suggest an intelligent watchmaker, evidences of design in the natural order suggest an intelligent, purposive world maker. and that creator is God

### David Hume's Critique
* argument from design is an argument from analogy. however, the universe is not analogous enough to human artifacts like a watch to sustain the argument
    * rebutal: both the universe and human artifacts belong to the calss of thigns which exhibit the curious adaptation of means to ends. since we can't think of any artifact belonging to this class which isn't the product of intelligent and conscious design, we may rightly infer that the world, as part of that class, also exhibits adaptation of means to ends as a result of intelligent design
* it proves little to point to various evidences of design in the universe. any universe, regardless of origin, will look designed
* argument from intelligent design at most establishes a finite God. the world (the effect) is finite and imperfect, so to produce this world all that is needed is a cause that is equal to or greater than the effect. but a cause that is even greater than the effect needn't be infinite
* it is illegitimate to make probability judgements in matters where the items under discussion is unique, and the origin of the universe is unique. since we have only one instance, how can we judge that universes most probably are designed by God
    * rebutal: a thing's uniqueness (and in some sense everything is unique) does not entail that it has no quality in common with anything else. the world does share a quality with other artifacts, and that quality is crucial for the argument from design

## Moral Arguments

### C. S. Lewis's Moral Argument
* there exists a universal sense of moral law, but it is also universally true that people break that law
* Lewis knows that some will object that this moral law is only our herd instinct, and as an instinct it must have developed like any other instinct, but Lewis denies this. indeed, we have various instints, but none of them tells us whether we should follow it; it is just there. for example, we may have an instinct to help a drowning man but also an instinct to preserve our own life. having these instincts doesn't tell us which to follow. only a moral law tells us that; therefore, the jmoral law must be different than a mere instinct
* others think the moral law is nothing omre than a matter of mere convention taught by parents and friends. Lewis grants that morality is at least in part taught by parents, but he denies it is a mere convention. he likens the moral law to mathematics. mathematics must also be taught, but a convention is something that reflects the peculiar tastes of a particular scoiety. it need not be the same from one society to the next. obviously, mathematics can't change from one society to the next. likewise, the moral law isn't mere convention, as is evidenced by the fact that from one culture to another there is great similarity in moral codes. moreover, it makes sense to talk about some moralities as better than others and to speak of moral progress, but how could this be if there were no constant standard of morality that doesn't change from time to time and place to place?
* the moral law isn't like the laws of nature. the laws of nature doesn't tell us what should happen. the moral law tells us how to behave. it prescribes behavior. from whence comes this sense of obligation or prescription that we feel? something behind the universe which is more like a mind than anything else we know. that something is the soure of the moral obligation we feel. each of us senses that there is something beyond the moral law; it didn't just happen that we have that sense of obligation. if what is true of us is true of others, we have reason to think that others feel there is something beyond us. when we examine the universe and the moral law, it is best to conclude that the something or someone beyond is God

### Objections
* moral laws and values are subjective. cultural relativism - interprets moral obligations in terms of social approval and siapproval
* objectivity of the moral law and the fact of conscience can be explained in a totally naturalistic way. moral values and conscience arose as man evolved. the higher that life-forms became, the more people had to learn to live together in society by rules that protect everyone. societies without such rules simply did not survive, whereas others that developed morality and lived by it found they were better able to survive. so, moral laws and conscience can be explained as the natural outcome of the evolutionary process. there is no need to appeal to God
* ethical norms reflect the collective pressure of society rather than divine revelation of moral law
* moral arguments are probabilistic in nature. the only reason each side accepts as more probable its own explanation is that each side begs the question. each side is committed to its view before discussion begins, so the arguments become irrelevant for both sides. arguments like the moral argument get us no closer to the truth about whether God exists

## General Value of Theistic Arguments
* the only argument that would establish the existence of the Judaeo-Christian God with all his attributes (if it worked) is the ontological argument. unfortunately, it is the hardest to understand, and many think it is least likely to be correct
* all of the theistic arguments are valuable in showing that theistic belief is not thoroughly irrational. for theists, they offer rational confirmation of their belief. for atheists/agnostics, they provide rational grounds for belief in God. none of the arguments alone provides a conclusive proof, but they are just the sort of evidences one would find helpful in making an overall cumulative case for God's existence
* sophisticated and interesting pieces of philosophical reasoning, regardless of their accuracy or inaccuracy. even convinced atheistic philosophers agree that the ontological argument is extremely important philosophically because of what it teaches us about topics such as the nature of necessity

## The Reality of God

### God is Real
* God exists outside the mind. we can speak of his nature and existence not merely as concepts, but as descriptions of a real being

### God is a Being
* God is a being, not being-itself, the ground of being, the power of being, or the structure of being
* God is distinct from creation
* since scripture claims that no God and nothing else is identical to the true and living God (hence, it is impossible to represent him through any image), it is safe to say that the biblical God is neither the God of pantheism nor the GOd of panentheism

## God as a Perfect, Necessary, and Infinite Being

### A Perfect Being
* perfect being theology informs us that God must have all perfections a divine being can have (and each to the highest degree), but that does not tellus the list of characteristics God actually has. it is here that we must supplement perfect being theology with creation theology and biblical teaching in order to get as full-orbed a concept of God's being as possible

### A Necessary Being
* two meanings of necessary:
    * true for all possible worlds. a possible world is a complete sequence of persons, objects, events, and actions throughout the whole history of that world from beginning to end. philosophers often hold that there is an infinite number of possible worlds, though only one is actual
        * any attribute God has in a given possible world is part of his essential nature
        * he exists in every possible world
    * as opposed to contingent. something contingent doesn't have to exist, but it can. as contingent, it is brought into and maintained in existence by something else. moreover, contingent things can cease to exist. in contrast, necessary beings depend on nothing for their existence; they neither come into nor go out of existence
* scripture clearly affirms that God has always existed and always will. Jesus says that the Father has life within himself, and has given to the SOn to have life in himself as well. Scripture emphatically proclaims God as the creator of all things, but it never speaks of God as created or as a creature. these biblical ideas taken together lead to God is a necessary being, not contingent
* as to God being necessary in the sense of existing inall possible worlds, scripture never directly says this of him. scripture says that nothing was made without his agency, and it is reasonable to infer from such verses that the writers believe that GOd is not only the creator, but also the only one with power to create anyting. if so, he exists for this possible world, and it is hard to imagine how any other possible world could become actual without God creating it. so it is hard to imagine God as absent from any possible world. what scripture does say about GOd as the sole person with power to create suggests that it isn't inconsistent with scripture to say that God is necessary in this sense

### An Infinite Being
* there are no limitations on God, except the laws of logic and his other attributes
* we must understand God's infinity or limitlessness in a qualitative sense, not a quantitative sense. to say that God is infinite in love, justice, power, wisdom, or knowledge is not to say that he has an infinite amount of these qualities. instead, it means that his attributes are qualitatively unlimited and thus make him a qualitatively different kind of being than anything else in the universe
    * for example GOd's power is not hte sum total of all the power there is and could be. instead, as omnipotent, he has the kind of power which allows him to do anything that is doable in conjunction with the laws of logic and the particulars of his character. to say that God is unlimited in knowledge and power to think does not mean that his mind is the sum total of all existing minds plus all possible minds. it means that there are no limitations to his cognitive powers. as a result, he knows all true propositions, though not because he has more mind quantitatively and hence has a big enough mind to store all theat informaiton. rather, the mind he has functions so well that it is capable of knowing all things, and knowing them at once

## God as Spirit
* material things are extended and bounded things. we can observe where one material object ends and another begins. material things don't think
* in contrast, immaterial things are not made of matter, are not extended, and have no physical boundaries. the basic characteristic of immaterial objects is consciousness or cognition, i.e., immaterial things are thinking things
* human nature has traditionally been understood as a combination of a material thing and an immaterial substance. this mind-body substance dualism has been with us at least since the French philosopher REne Descartes. to date no one has offered an entirely satisfactory explanation for how thinking things that are not extended or bounded causally interact with material things that have those characteristics but do not think. hence especially in the 20th century many opted for a materialist view of mind, denying altogether the existence of immaterial substances
* traditionally, Jewish and Christian thinkers have maintained that the God of scripture is an immaterial being, pure spirit
* John 4 - Jesus says God is spirit
* God revealing his presence on various occasions portrayed in a physical or material way. moreover, scripture often speaks of God as if he has material parts. theologians repeatedly call such language anthropomorphic
* Luke 24 - spirit does not have flesh and bones - spirit can be seen
* spirit must be invisible because immaterical contain no matter
* 1 Tim 1:17 - God is invisible
* although God's essential nature is spirit, that does not preclude him from making his presence known through some physical phenomenon that manifests his presence to those who see or hear it

## Implications of God as Spirit
* the basic characteristics of immaterial things is that they think. he reveals information about himself, he deliberates and chooses a plan of action, and he knows all things. his intellect is of the highest order
* God is pure spirit in light of his invisibility
* incorruptible and immortal. incorruptible means that his being cannot at all decay or deteriorate. immortal means he doesn't die. this is because he is immaterial
* living. immaterial part of human nature that brings it to life. only when the spirit enters our body do we come alive. whether or not one entirely agrees, it is true that Scripture pictures God as living
* divine simplicity means that God is an uncompounded being and does not consist of parts

## God as Person/Personal
* the question of what it means to be a human person is a notoriously difficult philosophical issue
* person - as that term is typically used, it at least means that the individual can interact rationally with his or her environment
* as some theologians have argued, to qualify as a person, one's reasoning abilities must be of the sort that allow the individual to be self-conscious and self-determining
    * self-conscious: humans not only experience pain but also know that they have a body distinct from other things and that their body is in pain. moreover, they can compare this sensation with other sensations they have had and understand that there is a continuous consciousness which possessed both the earlier and later sensations
    * self-determining: ability to make decisions and carry them out. self-determination involves having the intellectual capacity to consider and weigh alternative courses of action, plus the use of one's mental faculties to make decisions in accord with one's desires, not as a result of being forced to act by another
    * animals don't seem to have these
* personal - relatedness and involvement with others
* God is both a person and a personal being (as defined above)
* scripture agrees with this:
    * self-consciousness:
        * God is capable of conscious rational thought, is thoroiughly self-conscious
        * God shows his self-awareness by telling his people that there is no God like him
        * on various occasions God expresses his emotions or speaks of his intention to act in accord with those emotions. he says this of his anger, his jealousy, his compassion and mercy, and the like. such passages indicate God's awareness either of his current mental state at the time of the utterance or of his intention to act in accord with his emotions, but that is impossible unless he is conscious of himself and his own character traits
        * all scripture is the result of God's breath. that is, he has revealed it; he has spoken it all. as we read scripture, we find much information about God's character and action. how could God know this information if he were not conscious of himself as a distinct being?
        * divine self-consciousness is a logical corollary of divine omniscience. in knowing everything that is knowable, God must know himself and everything about himself
    * self-determination:
        * not only can he choose as he pleases, but he also has power to do whatever he chooses. if God decides to do something, no one can stop him. works all things according to the counsel of his will. God's decisions are based solely on his own purposes and desires, and his purposes and desires are based on no one and nothing other than himself. God is no robot; he has the power of self-determination
    * personal:
        * hears and answers prayer. comforts and gives strength and help to those who suffer and mourn. judges the wicked. blesses the righteous. loves us. sent his Son into the world to die for us
* God is a relational God, and if so, then he is personal in the sense of being involved inour world and related to its inhabitants
