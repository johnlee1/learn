## Introduction to Theistic Proofs
* philosophy
    * impossible to prove God's existence, but deemed belief in God necessary, anyway
    * none of the traditional theistic proofs issound, but we must postualte God's existence anyway. without it, there seems to be no ultimate grounding for morality
    * God's existence can't be proved by traditional arguments, but that doesn't destroy theism. theists can claim to know God exists by some noncognitive means, such as personal experience
    * belief in God does not rest on argument/evidence, nor need it do so in order for them to be within their epistemic rights in holding such a belief. rather, for those believers, belief in God is properly basic and thoroughly rational, even if they haven't marshaled any evidence/argument for their belief
* theology
    * the theistic argument will convince no one who isn't already a believer, but for believers, these proofs offer grounds for thinking that their faith is not utterly irrational
    * one or more of the arguments is successful
    * rational arguments for God are irrelevant. for those who have experienced God in a revelatory encounter, what possible rational argument could wrest from them their belief in God? the truth and living God is not some static proposition that comes at the end of a demonstrative proof; he is the dynamic, living God of the universe! as for nonbelievers, it is equally dubious that a rational argument will convince them of God's existence
* traditional arguments for God's existence are either a priori or a posteriori. a posteriori - appeals to some feature about the universe as a basis for arguing to God. a priori - does not do that. instead, if one understands the concepts used in the argument, one can decide whether the argument is true or false apart from any empirical investigation. a true a p riori argument is absolutely certain, whereas the premises and conclusion of an a posteriori argument are at best 99% probable. the ontological argument is the only one of the traditional proofs that is an a priori argument. 
    * a posteriori
        * some, like the cosmological argument, move from some fact about the world to a conclusion that purportedly follows inevitably from the premises of the argument. while the fat about the world is at best highly probable, nonetheless, if one grants it, some conclusion follows inevitably from it
        * many a posteriori arguments are intentionally probabilistic in form. appeal is made to some empirical fact, and various explanations of that fact are offered. one particular explanation is then deemed most probably true. teleological and moral arguments typically follow this form

## The Ontological Argument

### Anselm I
* The idea of God as the greatest conceivable being (GCB) is in everyone's understanding, but that, of course, commits no one to belief in God's existence in reality. Anselm thinks it should, however, for if we really understand what it means to be the GCB, we should immediately see that a being which exists both in the understanding and in reality is greater tahn a being who exists only in the understanding. so God, the GCB, exists

### Criticisms of Anselm I
* conceivability of something doesn't guarantee its existence
    * Anselm reply is that this is not true for an infinite, necessary being
* Immanuel Kant
    * 1) according to the ontological argument, the statement "the GCB exists" is analytics. an analytic statement is one whose predicate term is contained in the subject term. that is, if one understands the meaning of the subject term ("GCB") and the predicate term ("exists"), one immediately sees whether what is said is true, for the meaning of the subject term either does or does not contain the meaning of hte predicate. the ontological argument maintains that if one understands the meaning of "God," one must immediately understand that God exists. Kant complained that all claims about something's existence are synthetic, not analytics. a synthetic statement is one whose predicate concept is not contained in its subject concept. by understanding the meaning of hte subject term, one does not automatically know whether what is said about it (the predicate) is true; one must investigate
    * 2) existence is not a perfection. the ontological argument assumes that it is, but it isn't
    * 3) existence is not a predicate. once one describes the nature of God, to add that he exists adds nothing to the description of his nature. instead, it merely asserts that the definition applies to something actual in the world

### Anselm II
* we can think of a being who can be conceived not to exist, and we can also conceive of a being who cannot be conceived not to exist. in philosophical terminology, the former is a contingent being and the latter is a necessary being. something contingent depends on something other than itself for existence and hence must be brought into existence. a necessary being depends on nothing but itself and cannot go out of existence. Anselm reasons that if God is the GCB, he cannot be contingent, since then he wouldn't be the GCB, for a necessary being surely greater than a contingent one. so, a proper understanding of God as the GCB should convince us that God must exist and must do so as a necessary being. while contingent beings are not actual just because someone conceives of them, that is not so for God. in Anselm I, existence is considered a perfection, but in Anselm II necessary existence is the perfection

### Interaction with Anselm II
* John Hick believes that a major problem with Anselm II is that it tells us what kind of existence God must have if he exists, but offers no proof of his existence. that is, what Anselm actually proved is that a contingent being could not be God. any being worth of the title "God" must be a necessary being, for necessary existence is surely greater than contingent existence. but none of this establishes that in fact there is such a being

## The Cosmological Argument

### Casual Arguments

#### Aquinas's First Way
* some things in our world are in motion or changing. but if something is in the process of changing to another state, it is potentially in that state but not actually there. it is impossible for the same thing to be in teh state of actuality and potentiality in the same respect. whatever moves from the state of potentiality to actuality cannot move itself; it must be moved by something already in the state of actuality. however, whatever changes something else is itself changed, but there cannot be an infinite regress of movers or changers, for then there would be no first mover, and, consequently, no other mover, since subsequent movers move only inasmuch as they are moved by the first mover. thus, there must be a first mover, and he is God
* objection: if one thing causes another to change, the mover must actually be in the state toward which the changing object moves
* objection: things are as a brute fact in motion is not impossible. it is also possible that things in motion have been in motion eternally, so they never began to change
* objection: why can there not be an infinite regress of changers?
* objection: why God is the unchanged changer?

### Contingency Arguments
* principle of sufficient reason, according to which nothing ever happens without a sufficient reason why it occurs rather than something else. hence, everything that happens is explainable, at least in principle. in our world, we see nothing but contingent beings. of course, whatever is contingent owes its reason for existence to something else. the problem is that if everything is contingent, then everything owes its reason for existence to something else; we need a sufficient reason outside the series of contingent objects to have a sufficient reason for the existence of the whole. what is required is a being which depends on nothing but itself, and thus needs no further explanation than itself to explain why it exists. that means there must be a necessary being (one who causes his own existence) if we are to find a sufficient reason and explanation as to why the world as a whole exists. that necessary being is God
* objection: matter is eternal, how can God cause his own existence, we don't use necessary being to explain other historical events (we don't go back that far), scientists deem it true that everything has a cause which explains it for whatever happens but not in regard to whatever exists (science doesn't show this), some things are just brute facts

### Swinburne's Inductive Argument
* the probability that our universe should exist as a result of creation by God is greater than the probability that it should exist of itself
* objection: 
    * why? the universe's existence could be an inexplicable brute fact. 
    * the God-hypothesis necessitates that a non-embodied being has intentions about creating a world and accomplishes them, though he has no material parts to his being that would allow him to do anything in ways creatures normally do things. given our lack of experience of non-embodied beings, it is highly improbable, that any should exist, let alone create a world

## Teleological Argument

### William Paley: The Watch and the Watchmaker
* if he found a watch, watch has various parts that have been put together for a purpose. its parts move so as to indicate the hour of the day. having observed the various mechanisms in the watch, we must conclude that it had a maker who understood its construction and designed its use. we would conclude this even if we had never seen a watch made, even if the watch didn't always function properly, even if we couldn't discover the function of some of the watch's parts. no one would think there was a principle of order inherent in things that automatically caused the pieces of the watch to come together. suppose we found that the watch had the ability to manufacture other watches so that the watch itself was probably produced by a previous watch. that still wouldn't cause us to question the design of the watch. instead, we would marvel at the intelligence that produced the original watch in such a way as to allow the production of further watches
* apply this line of reasoning to the world. by analogy, we can see that nature gives evidences of design and purpose just as the watch does. various organisms and organs are fitted together so that creatures can survive. as evidences of design in teh watch suggest an intelligent watchmaker, evidences of design in the natural order suggest an intelligent, purposive world maker. and that creator is God

### David Hume's Critique
* argument from design is an argument from analogy. however, the universe is not analogous enough to human artifacts like a watch to sustain the argument
    * rebutal: both the universe and human artifacts belong to the calss of thigns which exhibit the curious adaptation of means to ends. since we can't think of any artifact belonging to this class which isn't the product of intelligent and conscious design, we may rightly infer that the world, as part of that class, also exhibits adaptation of means to ends as a result of intelligent design
* it proves little to point to various evidences of design in the universe. any universe, regardless of origin, will look designed
* argument from intelligent design at most establishes a finite God. the world (the effect) is finite and imperfect, so to produce this world all that is needed is a cause that is equal to or greater than the effect. but a cause that is even greater than the effect needn't be infinite
* it is illegitimate to make probability judgements in matters where the items under discussion is unique, and the origin of the universe is unique. since we have only one instance, how can we judge that universes most probably are designed by God
    * rebutal: a thing's uniqueness (and in some sense everything is unique) does not entail that it has no quality in common with anything else. the world does share a quality with other artifacts, and that quality is crucial for the argument from design

## Moral Arguments

### C. S. Lewis's Moral Argument
* there exists a universal sense of moral law, but it is also universally true that people break that law
* Lewis knows that some will object that this moral law is only our herd instinct, and as an instinct it must have developed like any other instinct, but Lewis denies this. indeed, we have various instints, but none of them tells us whether we should follow it; it is just there. for example, we may have an instinct to help a drowning man but also an instinct to preserve our own life. having these instincts doesn't tell us which to follow. only a moral law tells us that; therefore, the jmoral law must be different than a mere instinct
* others think the moral law is nothing omre than a matter of mere convention taught by parents and friends. Lewis grants that morality is at least in part taught by parents, but he denies it is a mere convention. he likens the moral law to mathematics. mathematics must also be taught, but a convention is something that reflects the peculiar tastes of a particular scoiety. it need not be the same from one society to the next. obviously, mathematics can't change from one society to the next. likewise, the moral law isn't mere convention, as is evidenced by the fact that from one culture to another there is great similarity in moral codes. moreover, it makes sense to talk about some moralities as better than others and to speak of moral progress, but how could this be if there were no constant standard of morality that doesn't change from time to time and place to place?
* the moral law isn't like the laws of nature. the laws of nature doesn't tell us what should happen. the moral law tells us how to behave. it prescribes behavior. from whence comes this sense of obligation or prescription that we feel? something behind the universe which is more like a mind than anything else we know. that something is the soure of the moral obligation we feel. each of us senses that there is something beyond the moral law; it didn't just happen that we have that sense of obligation. if what is true of us is true of others, we have reason to think that others feel there is something beyond us. when we examine the universe and the moral law, it is best to conclude that the something or someone beyond is God

### Objections
* moral laws and values are subjective. cultural relativism - interprets moral obligations in terms of social approval and siapproval
* objectivity of the moral law and the fact of conscience can be explained in a totally naturalistic way. moral values and conscience arose as man evolved. the higher that life-forms became, the more people had to learn to live together in society by rules that protect everyone. societies without such rules simply did not survive, whereas others that developed morality and lived by it found they were better able to survive. so, moral laws and conscience can be explained as the natural outcome of the evolutionary process. there is no need to appeal to God
* ethical norms reflect the collective pressure of society rather than divine revelation of moral law
* moral arguments are probabilistic in nature. the only reason each side accepts as more probable its own explanation is that each side begs the question. each side is committed to its view before discussion begins, so the arguments become irrelevant for both sides. arguments like the moral argument get us no closer to the truth about whether God exists

## General Value of Theistic Arguments
* the only argument that would establish the existence of the Judaeo-Christian God with all his attributes (if it worked) is the ontological argument. unfortunately, it is the hardest to understand, and many think it is least likely to be correct
* all of the theistic arguments are valuable in showing that theistic belief is not thoroughly irrational. for theists, they offer rational confirmation of their belief. for atheists/agnostics, they provide rational grounds for belief in God. none of the arguments alone provides a conclusive proof, but they are just the sort of evidences one would find helpful in making an overall cumulative case for God's existence
* sophisticated and interesting pieces of philosophical reasoning, regardless of their accuracy or inaccuracy. even convinced atheistic philosophers agree that the ontological argument is extremely important philosophically because of what it teaches us about topics such as the nature of necessity
