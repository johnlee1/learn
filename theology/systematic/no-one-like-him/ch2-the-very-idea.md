## What Sort of Reality is God/Does God Have?

### God as Mental Projection
* God doesn't exist as anything external to our minds but is merely an idea

### God as Being-Itself
* Paul Tillich
    * God is not a being and is not subject to categories of finitude, especially space and substance
    * think of God as ground of being, or being-itself
    * understood as the power of being, God is the power which resists nonbeing, a power inherent in everything
    * God has reality independent of minds that conceive him
    * God cannot be put into a grid where he is compared to other beings, for there is a radical and absolute cleavage between all beings and God
* John Macquarrie
    * transcends all beings, for without it nothing can or does exist
    * letting-be of all beings in that it enables and empowers them to be and is that hwhich brings things into being
        * inclusive of everything that is, but it lies behind all beings and is more ultimate
        * not a pantheistic view, which sees God's being as identical with the universe's being
    * akin to the relationship of life to the members of the body. life transcends the members, but neither is conceivable without the other

### God as a Being

#### God as an Immaterial Being

#### God as a Material Being

#### God as an Immaterial and Material Being

### God Without or Beyond Being
    * rejection of being theology and onto-theology
        * onto-theology - God is just one being (albeit the supreme one) among others for whom he is the source and ground. if we imagine being as a great chain of existing things going from infinite being to absolute finitude, God is in one sense distinct from all else, but he is still part of an overall structure which he grounds
    * in all creatures there is a distinction between their essence and their existence. that is, we can describe what they would be like if they existed, but for them to exist they must be brought into being or existence. in God's case, the essence/existence distinction collapses; he just is
    * God should not be thought of along traditional lines we use for thinking of other beings
    * not to think of God's reality in any way that invokes onto-theology

## What Role(s) Does God Play in Our Universe?

### Biblical Images, Motifs, and Metaphors for God
* God enters into relationships with his creatures
    * family/intepersonal relationships e.g. father, mother, husband, friend, lover
    * work/profession e.g. shepherd, artist
    * national settings e.g. monarch, judge
    * savior, deliverer, redeemer of his people
* portrays God as involved in the world and concerned for our well-being and desiring a relationship with us

### The Transcendence and Immanence of God
* transcendence means God is separate from and independent of the natural order and human beings
* immanence means that God is present to and in the natural order, human nature, and history

### Several Models of Christian Theism

#### The Classical Model
* absoluteness - internally totally unrelated to the world. he bears no relation to it either by way of his knowledge of it or his actions
* absolute perfection - cannot become better than he is, for he is already the best. no being surpasses him or even could, for he is the greatest conceivable being
* pure actuality - everything existing thing except God is a combination of actuality and potentiality. hence, they can grow and change. potentiality is an imperfection, for whatever has potentiality is not fully the being it might be. since God is a perfect being, he must be totally actual with no potentiality to become anything more than he is
* necessity - God is necessary. God exists necessarily rather than contingently. unlike contingent things that can come into existence or go out of existence, God as necessary can do neither. it is impossible for him to not exist. necessity means that the various divine attributes are essential to his being; losing any of them, he could not be God. necessity means that every truth about God is necessarily true. there are not claims about him that happen to be true but did not need to be (i.e., they are contingent)
* immutability - devoid of any change, and in fact cannot change. he is changeless in his being, attributes, will, and purposes, but his knowledge also is unchangeable and he cannot change relationally. he cannot decide to forego some action he intended to do, and even if a sinner repents, God cannot change his relation to him from alienation to fellowship
* impassibility - cannot change emotionally. cannot become angry, sad, or happy. God does not actually fell emotion. whether or not he is aware of our pain as we suffer, he certainly cannot feel it himself and suffer along with us. he cannot be acted upon. no one's prayers or arguments can actually move God to do anything he has not already planned to do
* timelessness - exists out of time. he sees all of time as an eternal "now"
* simplicity - devoid of all composition; he is not made up of different parts. cannot divide off God's essence from his attributes, nor ontologically is one one attribute separate from another. God's attributes are identical with his essence, and this requires by logical implication that each of his attributes is identical with one another
* omniscience - God exhaustively knows everything that can be known
* omnipotence - can do anything that is not a contradiction or contrary to his nature
* creation ex nihilo - God used his power to create our universe out of nothing
* incorporeality - immaterial, in no way composed of matter
* emphasis on God's sovereignty

#### The Process Model
* process God is dipolar. God has an immaterial, primordial, conceptual pole, and a physical, consequent pole. the latter pole is our world
* absoluteness denied - God as internally related to his creatures through his knowledge of them and interaction with them
* absolute perfection denied - God is constantly in the process of becoming. God continues to grow/develop, he always surpasses his prior greatness
* pure actuality denied - he is not as perfect as he could be and will be, but he has many possibilities for change/improvement
* mutability - changes in relationships, being, attributes, knowledge
* passibility - experienes our experienes as we have them. suffers/rejoices with us. responds when we pray
* temporality - enmeshed in time
* omniscience denied - knowledge is finite and growing
* omnipotence denied - power is finite and its operation in our world is always subject to the limitations put upon it by human freedom
* creation ex nihilo denied - matter is eternal
* incorporeality denied - God's primordial pole is immaterial, but it is not a distinct being. his consequent pole, the world, is very much filled with corporeal things
* emphasis on human free will

#### The Openness Model
* God is incorporeal
* God created the universe ex nihilo
* God has necessary existence and is absolutely perfect
* deny God is internally unrelated to his creation (i.e. that he is absolute)
* dynamically relates/responds to his creatures
* God's nature/attributes immutable, but changes his relationships
* impassibility denied - God has feelings/emotions
* timelessness denied - God subject to passage of time
* humans have libertarian free will
* God is absolutely sovereign, but out of love for his creatures he has granted some power to them and refrains from exercising all his power. God takes the risks that free creatures pose
* God is omnipotent in that he can do whatever is logically consistent and consistent with his nature
* omniscient about everything that can be known (does not include future since humans have libertarian free will)

### Three Understandings of the Metaphysics of Christian Theology
* theonomy
    * only God must exist, and he must have unlimited and unrestricted freedom to do whatever he pleases
    * whatever rules of ethics, epistemology, physics, etc., obtain in our universe are chosen by God, and he is free to choose any laws he wants
    * the only way to know how the universe runs and what the rules are is through divine revelation of God's choices, and not at all through reason
* reason rules
    * all laws of logic, ethics, etc., are necessary laws in the universe
    * whatever is true in this universe is discernible by the light of pure reason alone unaided by revelation
    * God is prior to logic, logic is prior to theology. even God dare not violate the dictates of reason
* modified rationalism
    * there are things intrinsically good or evil apart from what God says about them
    * God works within the rules of reason
    * one can often discern by reason why things are as they are. some things, however, are knowable only by revelation

## How Should We Understand Language about God
* functional approach
    * focus on psychological terms such as "know," "will," "intend," and "love"
    * though there are substantial differences between God and human beings, there is some univocity in predications of God and us
    * it is possible to identify a common core of meaning in terms for human and divine psychological states
    * the radical otherness of God might manifest itself in the _way_ in which common abstract features are realized in the divine being
    * there is a thing that performs a certain function. the internal nature of the thing that so performs is not specified. the crucial point is that a functional concept of X is non-committal as to the intrinsic nature, character, composition or structure of X
    * the fundamental function of the psyche, according to functionalism, is to regulate behavior. whether behavior is carried out by a physical body, as usually happens in our case, or some other way, the regulation of that behavior is the psyche's role
    * knowing something could be equally applicable to God and us, even though what it is to know something is true may differ radically between God and us. the function played by both the divine and human psyches is the same, even though how God goes about knowing may be a mystery to us
        * while we don't know exactly what it is to purpose as God does, we know the result and we know what it means for us to purpose and bring something about
        * both God's and our psyche can function in similar ways, even if we don't understand everything about what it is to be God or about knowing and purposing as he does
    * e.g. if God has no body to move, how can he _do_ anything, in the same sense in which an embodied human being does things? but this is not an insuperable difficulty. the core concept of human action is not _movement of one's own body,_ but rather _bring about a change in the world - directly or indirectly - by an act of will, decision, or intention_. That concept can be intelligibly applied to a purely spiritual deity. it is just that we will have to think of God as bringing about changes in the 'external' world directly by an act of will - not directly through moving his boyd, as in our case
    * meaningfulness of theological language - despite differences between God and us, there is enough commonality in functional psychological states to say that our human psychological concepts of these functional states yield ideas that literally apply to God and hence generate theological statements that unproblematically possess truth values
