## What is Modernity?

* began with Rene Descartes (1596-1650) in philosophy and with Galileo and Isaac Newton in science
* period continued into the 19th century rationalism and scientism

### Human Consciousness ("The Subjective Turn")
* era prior to Descartes was one of tradition and authority
* God is no longer the "starting point" of philosophy. Human consciousnessness is, and along with it comes epistemology as the center-piece of philosophy
* it is up to human consciousness to structure and certify whatever is true
* transferred to man the function of God as the source of reality and intelligibility
* human consciousness takes the role of sitting in judgement of what is true in regard to reality
* prior to Immanuel Kant, the mind was deemed as fundamentally passive in the knowing process. sense data from the external world came to it through the sensory organs. Kant argued that not only does the world act upon the mind (through the senses), but the mind in virtue of various concepts inherent in it is also active. the mind structures the sense data and then makes a judgement about what is perceived. 
    * things-in-themselves v. things-as-they-appear-to-us
        * while things really exist outside of our mind, no one can experience them as they are in themselves
        * things which are not objects of our knowledge - noumena
        * things as they appear to us - phenomena
    * structuring the world from one's own consciousness
    * human consciousness as active, not passive
* increased emphasis on mind's action in an individual's understanding of reality
* ground knowledge ultimately in certain foundational beliefs - the key is empirical data
* emphasis on empircal data as the key to knowledge
* basing one's understanding of the world on the human consciousness' structuring of the world

### Knowledge, Truth, Objectivity, and Theory of Meaning
* reason was deemed capable of grasping and interacting correctly with the world, and it was held that this is true for all people
* the only beliefs that qualify as knowledge are beliefs supported by ultimately by foundational beliefs that are self-evident, evident to the senses, or incorrigible - the beliefs most capable of being justified are the beliefs of science
* beliefs not a matter of pure reason nor open to sense perception - Kant said these are noumena, not phenomena, and as such, they are not objects of knowledge
    * Kant claimed to put an end to metaphysics, for the subjects normally discussed in that discipline are beyond empirical investigation
* predominant theory of truth is the correspondence theory: propositional truth is a relation between language and our world. what we say about the world is said to correspond to or match what is true of the world
* objectivity is possible, and is most clearly seen in science
* characteristic of modern epistemology is emphasis on a representational or referential theory of language: words and sentences refer to objects, actions, and events. their meaning is what they refer to. typically, the referential theory in question considers the meaning invariant. this fits nicely with a theory of knowledge that says beliefs are to be justified in terms of more basic beliefs. beliefs can be shown true by seeing that the things they refer to are true of the world
    * "God is love" does not refer toa nything that can be verified by empirical observation - some disregard as meaningless, some say they express a speaker's emotional reaction or intentions to act in a certain way ("I like God" or "I think God is nice"), some say they express the utterer's intention to act a certain way ("God is love" = speaker intends to act in a loving way)

### Naturalism
