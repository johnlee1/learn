## What is Modernity?

* began with Rene Descartes (1596-1650) in philosophy and with Galileo and Isaac Newton in science
* period continued into the 19th century rationalism and scientism

### Human Consciousness ("The Subjective Turn")
* era prior to Descartes was one of tradition and authority
* God is no longer the "starting point" of philosophy. Human consciousnessness is, and along with it comes epistemology as the center-piece of philosophy
* it is up to human consciousness to structure and certify whatever is true
* transferred to man the function of God as the source of reality and intelligibility
* human consciousness takes the role of sitting in judgement of what is true in regard to reality
* prior to Immanuel Kant, the mind was deemed as fundamentally passive in the knowing process. sense data from the external world came to it through the sensory organs. Kant argued that not only does the world act upon the mind (through the senses), but the mind in virtue of various concepts inherent in it is also active. the mind structures the sense data and then makes a judgement about what is perceived. 
    * things-in-themselves v. things-as-they-appear-to-us
        * while things really exist outside of our mind, no one can experience them as they are in themselves
        * things which are not objects of our knowledge - noumena
        * things as they appear to us - phenomena
    * structuring the world from one's own consciousness
    * human consciousness as active, not passive
* increased emphasis on mind's action in an individual's understanding of reality
* ground knowledge ultimately in certain foundational beliefs - the key is empirical data
* emphasis on empircal data as the key to knowledge
* basing one's understanding of the world on the human consciousness' structuring of the world

### Knowledge, Truth, Objectivity, and Theory of Meaning
* reason was deemed capable of grasping and interacting correctly with the world, and it was held that this is true for all people
* the only beliefs that qualify as knowledge are beliefs supported by ultimately by foundational beliefs that are self-evident, evident to the senses, or incorrigible - the beliefs most capable of being justified are the beliefs of science
* beliefs not a matter of pure reason nor open to sense perception - Kant said these are noumena, not phenomena, and as such, they are not objects of knowledge
    * Kant claimed to put an end to metaphysics, for the subjects normally discussed in that discipline are beyond empirical investigation
* predominant theory of truth is the correspondence theory: propositional truth is a relation between language and our world. what we say about the world is said to correspond to or match what is true of the world
* objectivity is possible, and is most clearly seen in science
* characteristic of modern epistemology is emphasis on a representational or referential theory of language: words and sentences refer to objects, actions, and events. their meaning is what they refer to. typically, the referential theory in question considers the meaning invariant. this fits nicely with a theory of knowledge that says beliefs are to be justified in terms of more basic beliefs. beliefs can be shown true by seeing that the things they refer to are true of the world
    * "God is love" does not refer toa nything that can be verified by empirical observation - some disregard as meaningless, some say they express a speaker's emotional reaction or intentions to act in a certain way ("I like God" or "I think God is nice"), some say they express the utterer's intention to act a certain way ("God is love" = speaker intends to act in a loving way)

### Naturalism
* basic ontological doctrine of modernity is the mechanistic doctrine of anture
* with the rise of Newtonian science coupled w rationalism and empiricism in epsitemology, the world was thought of as a gigantic machine. this mechanistic view saw the physical world as composed of inanimate, insentient atoms which interact with one another by deterministic impact
* only truths available about our world come through the natural sciences. religion, theology, ethics, and metaphysics tell us nothing more about the world. explain everything that happens in our world in terms of natural processes
* led to gradual secularization of society. religion and theology could no longer be seen as serious intellectual disciplines and instead were marginalized and privatized

### Human Freedom and Individuality
* emphasis on the individual, individual rights and freedom
* throwing off of all authorities/tradition in favor of the individual
* each person is encouraged to decide on the basis of argument and evidence what is right to believe and do
* politically, emphasis on individual freedom gave rise to modern democracies
* fostered an attitude of self-sufficiency and self-reliance, isolation from community, and a belief that one may believe and do whatever one wants, so long as no one else's freedom and righst are abridged

### The Goodness of Human Nature
* problems of modern culture do not stem from moral or spiritual inadequacies. basic human nature is good, and people are rational enough to see hwhat is in their best interests. basic human goodness remains and can be tapped into through education

### Science and Progress
* prior to the modern era there was a fatalistic acceptance of anture and history as reflecting GOd's immutable ordering of the world. in contrast, the modern spirit promised to liberate humanity from fate and all other restraints
* modern world is built on and relies heavily on science and technology. the predominant attitude toward these developments is that they show human culture as continually progressing. science/tech are seen by many as the saviors of society, having the capacity to lead us to a utopia

## What is Postmodernity?
* the themes have been "brewing" for some time in the 20th century, but not until the late 1960s and after have these themes become more conscious and explicit

### Postmodern Epistemology
*
