## What is Modernity?
* began with Rene Descartes (1596-1650) in philosophy and with Galileo and Isaac Newton in science
* period continued into the 19th century rationalism and scientism

### Human Consciousness ("The Subjective Turn")
* era prior to Descartes was one of tradition and authority
* God is no longer the "starting point" of philosophy. Human consciousnessness is, and along with it comes epistemology as the center-piece of philosophy
* it is up to human consciousness to structure and certify whatever is true
* transferred to man the function of God as the source of reality and intelligibility
* human consciousness takes the role of sitting in judgement of what is true in regard to reality
* prior to Immanuel Kant, the mind was deemed as fundamentally passive in the knowing process. sense data from the external world came to it through the sensory organs. Kant argued that not only does the world act upon the mind (through the senses), but the mind in virtue of various concepts inherent in it is also active. the mind structures the sense data and then makes a judgement about what is perceived. 
    * things-in-themselves v. things-as-they-appear-to-us
        * while things really exist outside of our mind, no one can experience them as they are in themselves
        * things which are not objects of our knowledge - noumena
        * things as they appear to us - phenomena
    * structuring the world from one's own consciousness
    * human consciousness as active, not passive
* increased emphasis on mind's action in an individual's understanding of reality
* ground knowledge ultimately in certain foundational beliefs - the key is empirical data
* emphasis on empircal data as the key to knowledge
* basing one's understanding of the world on the human consciousness' structuring of the world

### Knowledge, Truth, Objectivity, and Theory of Meaning
* reason was deemed capable of grasping and interacting correctly with the world, and it was held that this is true for all people
* the only beliefs that qualify as knowledge are beliefs supported by ultimately by foundational beliefs that are self-evident, evident to the senses, or incorrigible - the beliefs most capable of being justified are the beliefs of science
* beliefs not a matter of pure reason nor open to sense perception - Kant said these are noumena, not phenomena, and as such, they are not objects of knowledge
    * Kant claimed to put an end to metaphysics, for the subjects normally discussed in that discipline are beyond empirical investigation
* predominant theory of truth is the correspondence theory: propositional truth is a relation between language and our world. what we say about the world is said to correspond to or match what is true of the world
* objectivity is possible, and is most clearly seen in science
* characteristic of modern epistemology is emphasis on a representational or referential theory of language: words and sentences refer to objects, actions, and events. their meaning is what they refer to. typically, the referential theory in question considers the meaning invariant. this fits nicely with a theory of knowledge that says beliefs are to be justified in terms of more basic beliefs. beliefs can be shown true by seeing that the things they refer to are true of the world
    * "God is love" does not refer toa nything that can be verified by empirical observation - some disregard as meaningless, some say they express a speaker's emotional reaction or intentions to act in a certain way ("I like God" or "I think God is nice"), some say they express the utterer's intention to act a certain way ("God is love" = speaker intends to act in a loving way)

### Naturalism
* basic ontological doctrine of modernity is the mechanistic doctrine of anture
* with the rise of Newtonian science coupled w rationalism and empiricism in epsitemology, the world was thought of as a gigantic machine. this mechanistic view saw the physical world as composed of inanimate, insentient atoms which interact with one another by deterministic impact
* only truths available about our world come through the natural sciences. religion, theology, ethics, and metaphysics tell us nothing more about the world. explain everything that happens in our world in terms of natural processes
* led to gradual secularization of society. religion and theology could no longer be seen as serious intellectual disciplines and instead were marginalized and privatized

### Human Freedom and Individuality
* emphasis on the individual, individual rights and freedom
* throwing off of all authorities/tradition in favor of the individual
* each person is encouraged to decide on the basis of argument and evidence what is right to believe and do
* politically, emphasis on individual freedom gave rise to modern democracies
* fostered an attitude of self-sufficiency and self-reliance, isolation from community, and a belief that one may believe and do whatever one wants, so long as no one else's freedom and righst are abridged

### The Goodness of Human Nature
* problems of modern culture do not stem from moral or spiritual inadequacies. basic human nature is good, and people are rational enough to see hwhat is in their best interests. basic human goodness remains and can be tapped into through education

### Science and Progress
* prior to the modern era there was a fatalistic acceptance of anture and history as reflecting GOd's immutable ordering of the world. in contrast, the modern spirit promised to liberate humanity from fate and all other restraints
* modern world is built on and relies heavily on science and technology. the predominant attitude toward these developments is that they show human culture as continually progressing. science/tech are seen by many as the saviors of society, having the capacity to lead us to a utopia

## What is Postmodernity?
* the themes have been "brewing" for some time in the 20th century, but not until the late 1960s and after have these themes become more conscious and explicit

### Postmodern Epistemology
* each human consciousness must still structure its understanding of the world, but prospects of justifying one's beliefs by properly basic beliefs that are self-evident, evident to the senses, or incorrigible are gone
* rejection of foundationalism - if foundationalism's criteria for proper basicality is accepted, then foundationalism should be rejected for there is insufficient argument, evidence, and support for these criteria. none of the three criteria are self-evident, evident to the senses, or incorrigible, nor are they supported by other more basic beliefs that meet those requirements
* coherentist/holistic theory of knowledge - beliefs still must be justified by other beliefs, but not beliefs are more basic than any other. nor are any beliefs directly in touch with experience outside the mind in a way that would confirm them as self-evident or indubitable. knowledge is a web of interconnected beliefs
* in late 1960s and early 1970s Thomas Kuhn published The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Kuhn argued that despite the widely held belief that science operates with pristine objectivity and no bias in handling data, this is not so. there are no theory-neutral observations and no brute facts in our world that await our objective inspection. scientists' observations are colored by their conceptual framework, a framework that comes from their life situation, training as scientists, and knowledge of current scientific theory. it is impossible for a scientist to put presuppositions aside. observations of data are shaped by the scientist's language, concepts, training, and experience
* Kuhn distinguished what he called normal science and revolutionary science
    * normal science: once a scientific paradigm like Newtonian physics is accepted, scientists work within that paradigm to explain the phenomena and data of the world. their observations and conclusions are governed by the reigning theory
    * revolutionary science: as scientists work within a paradigm, they notice certain data and problems that don't quite fit the prevailing theory. at some point, anomalies with the current paradignm become so hard to overcome that it is scrapped in favor of a new paradigm. the switch does not come from a long, reasoned process that deductively or inductively yields the new view, but instead comes suddenly, almost like a conversion experience. once the revolution ends, normal science works within the new paradigm
* Richard Rorty's Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature - argued that for several hundred years after Descartes, philosophy has been held captive by a certain picture of knowledge. it is the view that sees the mind as the mirror of nature. various ideas are represented on that mirror, and then the individual compares those ideas with the world outside the mind. by these empmirical and rational processes, one can ultimately support one's beliefs and so provide a foundation for knowledge. it is this picture - one that assumes the mind as a rational, objective observer that must be rejected. people's conceptual framework, formed by their life experiences and by the linguistic and cultural community in which they were raised, is a major determining factor in how people view things and in what they actually perceive
* William Van Orman Quine
    * what we know and understand is a product of the communities in which we were raised
    * experience and our contact with it are such that there simply is insufficient evidence from experience for us to know which beliefs are true or false or whether our whole perspective on the world is right or wrong
    * structuring of reality from the perspective of our own conceptual grid
* the human condition is such that we are in no position to know that are beliefs correspond to the world through either senses or reason. our observations and reasoning are too theory-laden to allow that
* postmoderns typically adopt coherence theory of truth or pragmatic theory of truth, or combination of both
    * coherence theory of truth - what is true is the set of sentences that fit together without contradicting one another
    * pragmatic theory of truth - what is true is what offers the most workable results when believed
* there is no grand story, no "meta-narrative" that will somehow make sense of everything. only individual narratives, our individual perceptions of reality as we see it
* there is no absolute truth, or if there is, no one is in a position to know what it is. everyone is said to be a product of their cultural and linguistic community

### Naturalism, But...
* religious language is meaningful and is about something that somehow can be experienced. presents a given perspective on reality

### Human Freedom in Community
* emphasis on relatedness and community
* human freedom used to further personal goals and development as part of a larger program for growth of the whole community

### The Goodness of Human Nature
* 20th century atrocities disillusioned many about the goodness of human nature
* mixed messages about human nature

### Science and Progress
* science and technology are viewed as both blessing and bane
* evolution remains very heavily entrenched


## God In Contemporary Thought

### Contemporary Theologies in the Modern Mindset

#### Kant
* distinguished the noumenal from the phenomenal. the former contains things that are not objets of empirical investigation, and hence are not objects of knowledge. God is in the noumenal realsm. though God's existence cannot be proved, it must be postulate of practical reason necessary for moral governance of our world

#### Hegel (1770-1831)
* five distinct notions of God
    * psychological projection. self-consciousness
    * a force or general consciousness uniting all finite consciousnesses
    * equal to the infinite. God is equivalent to transcending, all-encompassing thought. not necessarily a person
    * representation is the human use of language adn thought to point to an object which is infinite. God is the object toward which religious representation points symbolically. he is totally transcendent and does not seem to act in the world. he may be personal, but he so totally other that it is impossible to know exactly how to describe him
    * God as Christ. Christ as uniting the infinite and finite in two ways. In Christ as incarnate, God and man are united, but beyond the incarnation, Christianity instructs its followers to believe in and follow Christ. this means that we should worship a person who is other than us and yet at the same time is the same as we. our relation to CHrist illustrates the union of the transcendent and immanent

#### Schleiermacher and Liberal Theology
* Schleiermacher claimed that religion is based on a feeling of absolute dependence
    * this feeling of absolute dependence is also a person's feeling of identity
    * feeling identical with what he labeled "immediate self-consciousness". we are able to discern this feeling because self-consciousness involves thinking and willing which allow us to relate rationally to our world. through all this we can distinguish our feeling of absolute dependence in relation to God from a feeling of relative dependence to things in the world. this happens because in the latter a person stands in relations of community and reciprocity with nature and society, while in the feeling of absolute dependence there is no reciprocity present
* Albrecht Ritschl - emphasized the moral nature of man as the basis of religion. religion provides the basic attitude toward reality and the basic values that make historical and personal development of humans as moral being possible
* various liberal theologies that followed based religion on either religious experience, the moral nature of man, or some combination thereof
* liberal theology accommodating itself to modernity in four creative ways
    * in light of the advances, discoveries, and new theories in physical science, the notion of Christian truth as divinely given infallible propositions about whatever bibilical writers discussed was rejected. instead, doctrinal claims were seen as human constructs that tried to explain the mystery of reality
    * doctrines themselves were no longer to be seen as eternal, unchanging truths, but as statements for a given age and time meant to reflect the cultural and historical situation of hte theologian's own times
    * christian life was no longer seen as directed by divine rules of holiness in preparation for achieving heaven upon death. rather, the purpose of christian living was to live a life devoted to making a difference in the present world. promotion of worldly values such as justice, freedom, and welfare of all peoples
    * a Christian's primary obligation is to love and tolerate all people, regardless of whether one shared their doctrinal commitments or not. rather than separating over views deemed heretical, love and tolerance of those with whom one differed was the order of the day. this stress on tolerance of personal freedom to hold one's won beliefs is very modern

#### Soren Kierkegaard (1813-1855)
* being a Christian does not involve knowing a bunch of objective facts and performing a set of religious rituals. rather, it consists in becoming a spiritual contemporary with Christ
* believes historical research is an approximation of the truth. this isn't enough for who would be so foolish as to rest their eteranl destiny on something contingent that is at best an approximation of the truth
* for someone to receive the truth, God must bring the truth to the individual. this happens only when God in grace encounters the individual and gives him the truth and also the faith to grasp it. God gives us the truth in the person of Jesus Christ, who is given to us in personal encounter. through repeated encounters and our response of faith, we become spiritually contemporary with Christ. the faith God gives is not mere cold, intellectual argreement, but a passionate holdong onto that which, rationally speaking, makes little or no sense.
* one's eternal destiny should not rest on the dictates of reason. for someone who has experienced God through the personal encounter with Christ, how could a rational argument possibly make them more certain/uncertain of God's existence? as for unbelievers, no argument or evidence could convince them, and given the contingency of our knwoeldge, why would they rest anything so important as their eternal destiny on such argumemnts

#### Karl Barth (1886-1968)
* revelation does not come in propositions - but in a person. the content of revelation is God himself given to man in a nonverbal, personal encounter with Jesus
* the God who has revealed himself is the deus absconditus. this is the God to whom there is no way and no bridge, of whom we could not say or have to say one single word had he not, of his own initiative, met us at deus revelatus. the God who is revealed is not actually the deus absconditus, the transcendent God. rather the hidden God has taken on a form in order to reveal himself to us. GOd's doing this is his distinguishing himself from himself, a being of God in a mode of existence, not subordinate as compared with his first hidden mode of being as God, but just different. the fact that God takes on this mode of existence to reveal himself doesn't mean that this mode fully reveals God. further, this mode of revelation is not the subject of revelation, becuase that would mean that God could be unveiled to us after all and that there was no longer any need of God (the hidden God) for his revelation after all. the transcendent God is important, even thoughwe cannot know him in his transcendence 
    * orthodoxy maintains that God can be known in his transcendent character
    * radical theologians say that the only GOd we can know is the deus revelatus in the form of Christ. he is the subject of revelation and does unveil the transcendent; hence the transcendent God is no longer needed
    * Barth takes a mediating position between orthodoy and the more radical theologians

#### Paul Tillich (1886-1965)
* distinguishes between teh sense and reference of "God"
    * the sense is that God is the name for what concerns us ultimately. what is of ultimate concern to humans must be that which is determinative of our being or nonbeing
    * as to the reference of "God" - Tillich says it is being-itself. being-itself is not just a being alongside of other beings, for beings are still subject to finitude. rather, God is the ground of being, the power of being, the structure of being. this is all we can say about God without lapsing into symbolism and metaphor
* this is a strange notion of God. on one hand, it pictures him as very immanent to all things. but there is no hint that he is personal, a God with whom we can establish any kind of relationship. moreover, Tillich's claim that there is nothing we can literally say about God other than that he is being-itself gives his God a certain remoteness and distance
* Jesus is the bridge between us and God. TIllich speaks of hte "new being" in Jesus as the Christ. new being is essential being under the conditions of existence, conquering the gap between essence and existence. twe have in Jesus essential being under the conditions of existence. this is being-itself under the concrete conditions of finitude

#### Logical Positivism and the Early Wittgenstein
* verification theory of meaning - unless one can specify verification procedures for a proposition, the proposition is meaningless. if it was impossible to state how to verify or falsify a claim, then the esentence was meaningless. moreover, whatever the sentence spoke of was nonexistent
    * for which kind of sentences could one specify verification procedures? fundamentally, only for sentences that are about empirically observable things in our world
    * for ethical/value claims and claims about religious/theological entities, we cannot state verification procedures. hence, such propositions are nonsense, and what they speak of doesn't exist
* Wittgenstein's theory of meaning was the picture theory of meaning. words are the names of objects to which they refer, and sentences picture state of affairs in our world. if a sentence doesn't picture a state of affairs in our world, it has no sense

#### Death of God Theologies (1960s)
* Nietzche - in the modern world there is no room for God. science can explain our world without reference to God, and the traditional God is too otherworldly to be relevant to modern man. if God lives, there is an ultimate authority to which all are accountable; but if God is dead, then anything becomes allowable and possible
* Thomas J. J. Altizer - rejection of the transcendent God and affirmation of a totally incarnate Word. this offers a faith that is totally engaged with the world, and rejects all forms that disengage from the world
    * Altizer means that "God is dead" not only in the sense that the transcndent God is irrelevant to modern man but also in the sense that God in becoming incarnate literally died in his primordial form. kenosis means a radical transformation of the primordial God into flesh
* believed that traditional Christian faith is a flight from life, an evasion of suffering, a refusal to bear the burden and anguish of the human condition

### Contemporary Theologies in the Postmodern Mindset

#### George Lindbeck's Threefold Categorization of Theologies
* 1) emphasizes cognitive aspects of religions and treats doctrines as assertions of fact about objective realities
* 2) stresses the experiential-expressive aspects of religion where the focus of religion is the experiences of the human subject
* 3) cultural-linguistic - religions are thought of as different idioms for construing reality, expressing expdrience, and ordering life

#### Theology of Hope
* arose in the 1960s with a strongly political emphasis
* preaching to 20th century people had to change to emphasize the church as active in shaping society rather than shaping individual lives. this emphasis on converting political and social structures to bring in the kingdom made Theology of Hope a political theology
* futuristic emphasis, theology done as eschatology. christianity as eschatology is hope, forward looking and forward moving. hence, it also revolutionizes and transforms the present
* the question of God's existence, like all questions, is open and will be solved in the future
* God with future as his essential nature
* in light of God's promises for the future and his power to transform it, christians called to social activism. cannot be satisfied with social and political status quo, but must proclaim a new order that is coming

#### Liberation Theology
