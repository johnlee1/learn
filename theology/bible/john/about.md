## Purpose, Occassion, and Background
* written by the apostle John, a Palestinian Jew and a member of Jesus' inner apostolic circle
* original audience consisted of both Jews and Gentiles living in the larger Greco-Roman world in Ephesus and beyond
* toward the close of the first century A.D.
* frequently explains Jewish customs and Palestinian geography and translates Aramaic terms into Greek - thus showing his awareness of non-Jewish readers
* presents Jesus as the Word become flesh against the backdrop of Greek thought that included Stoicism and early Gnosticism
    * stoicism: a school of Hellenistic philosophy that flourished throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century AD. Stoicism is predominantly a philosophy of personal ethics which is informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for humans is found in accepting this moment as it presents itself, by not allowing ourselves to be controlled by our desire for pleasure or our fear of pain, by using our minds to understand the world around us and to do our part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others in a fair and just manner
    * gnosticism: a modern name for a variety of ancient religious ideas and systems, originating in Jewish milieus in the first and second century AD
        * espouses a dualism regarding spirit and matter. Gnostics assert that matter is inherently evil and spirit is good. As a result of this presupposition, Gnostics believe anything done in the body, even the grossest sin, has no meaning because real life exists in the spirit realm only
        * Second, Gnostics claim to possess an elevated knowledge, a “higher truth” known only to a certain few. Gnosticism comes from the Greek word gnosis which means “to know.” Gnostics claim to possess a higher knowledge, not from the Bible, but acquired on some mystical higher plane of existence. Gnostics see themselves as a privileged class elevated above everybody else by their higher, deeper knowledge of God
