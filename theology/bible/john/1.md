## The Prologue of John
* John recorded the prologue to lay the theological foundation for his Gospel in which he presented Jesus as the Logos who was sent from God as the light and life for men
* the Word which had been existed since the beginning of time, the Word in time became flesh, because nobody had seen God
    * there was a need for God to reveal himself
    * the Word became flesh because no one has seen God
* in the beginning was the Word
    * eternality
    * pre-existence
* the word was with God
    * equality
    * personality
* the word was God
    * essence
    * deity
* the Word was with God, we saw his glory, and in reality it was because he was God
* "the word was God"
    * can't put definite article in front of God because it destroys the trinity, limits God to Jesus
    * don't need definite article to have it definite
    * no article when it is without question referring to the Father (see other verses in chapter 1)
* "he has made him known"
    * Jesus is the exegesis of the Father
* light is not simply the absence of darkness, but spiritually it is the enemy of darkness

## Why "Word"?
* John calls Jesus the Word because he had come to see the words of Jesus as the truth of God and the person of Jesus as the truth of God in such a unified way that Jesus himself - in his coming, and working, and teaching, an dying and rising - was the final and decisive Message of God
* what God had to say to us was not only or mainly what Jesus said, but who Jesus was and waht he did. his words clarified himself and his work. but his self and his work were the main truth God was revealing

## what we learn about Jesus
* the time of his existence
    * "in the beginning" identical to genesis 1:1
    * before anything was made, there was Jesus
    * before there was time, there was Jesus
    * before anything else was, he was
    * he did not come into being
* the essence of his identity
    * worship Jesus as God
* the relationship to God
    * Jesus was with God
    * he is God, and he has a relationship with God
    * distinct with God as a person, yet God
    * not easy, just clear
* his relationship to the world
    * all things were made through him
    * God's agent
    * by God's word, created all things - that word is God, God's agent is God
    * God created you through God

## The Word "Logos"
* greek thought: 
    * mediation, through principle
    * element of truth, idea that God would reveal
    * logos is lowest place God could come, highest place humanity could achieve
* hebrew thought:
    * revelation
    * wisdom, the personification of truth
* God one ups greek/hebrew thought. Jesus is a mediator, not a concept or idea, but person
