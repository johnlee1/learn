## Personality

### Jean Piaget: Constructivism
* knowledge is a process rather than state
* facts as tools rather than objective independent realities
* much of what you learn in biology today will be wrong in 20 years
* facts change over time. the only thing that doesn't change is the manner in which people generate facts, rather than the facts themselves
* knowledge structures change over time and are embedded in the social world
* the manner in which they change over time have a structure
* abstraction is built bottom-up from action - "clean room" example
    * "clean room" is too abstract, need to learn how to pick up toys and make bed first
