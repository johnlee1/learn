## Socrates (470-399 BC)

## Plato (427-347 BC)
* the worldview of Plato ("metaphysical dualism") involves a dualistic framework for reality: the immaterial "intelligible" world versus the material "perceptual" world. the former is eternal, consisting of ideal "forms," while the latter was created, comprised of corrupt "copies." Platonic protology involves the eternal ideal state and a debased material creation, which sets up its eschatological return to immateriality. salvation is thus found intranscending materiality by englihtenment and/or death

## Alexander III of Macedon (356–323 BC)
* Made it his life ambition to civilize and enlighten the entire known world of his time. In a stunning display of zeal and ambition, ALexander conquered kingdoms from the Ionian Sea to the HImalayas in only ten years (333-323 BC), creating the largest empire in the ancient world at his time. Founding nearly twenty cities that bore his own name, Alexander settled Greek colonists everywhere he went and ushered in what is known as the "Hellenistic Age" (323-30 BC). From this point it was only a matter of time before the ardent zeal of Hellenism would consume the ancient world, laying the historical foundation for the development of Western society

## Aristotle (384-322 BC)

## Charles Darwin (1809–1882)
* accounted for everything in terms of biological evolution

## Karl Marx (1818–1883)
* interpreted all events of history in economic categories, with the forces of dialectical materialism moving history toward the inevitable classless society

## Sigmund Freud (1856–1939)
* explained all human behavior in light of sexual energy, repression, and unconscious forces
