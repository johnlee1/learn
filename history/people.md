## Socrates (470-399 BC)

## Plato (427-347 BC)
* disciple of Socrates
* the worldview of Plato ("metaphysical dualism") involves a dualistic framework for reality: the immaterial "intelligible" world versus the material "perceptual" world. the former is eternal, consisting of ideal "forms," while the latter was created, comprised of corrupt "copies." Platonic protology involves the eternal ideal state and a debased material creation, which sets up its eschatological return to immateriality. salvation is thus found intranscending materiality by englihtenment and/or death

## Alexander III of Macedon (356–323 BC)
* disciple of Aristotle
* Made it his life ambition to civilize and enlighten the entire known world of his time. In a stunning display of zeal and ambition, ALexander conquered kingdoms from the Ionian Sea to the HImalayas in only ten years (333-323 BC), creating the largest empire in the ancient world at his time. Founding nearly twenty cities that bore his own name, Alexander settled Greek colonists everywhere he went and ushered in what is known as the "Hellenistic Age" (323-30 BC). From this point it was only a matter of time before the ardent zeal of Hellenism would consume the ancient world, laying the historical foundation for the development of Western society

## Aristotle (384-322 BC)
* disciple of Plato

## Immanuel Kant (1724–1804)
* German

## Charles Darwin (1809–1882)
* accounted for everything in terms of biological evolution

## Karl Marx (1818–1883)
* interpreted all events of history in economic categories, with the forces of dialectical materialism moving history toward the inevitable classless society

## Sigmund Freud (1856–1939)
* explained all human behavior in light of sexual energy, repression, and unconscious forces

## Auguste Comte (1798–1857)
* French philosopher who founded the discipline of praxeology and the doctrine of positivism

## Thomas Kuhn (1922–1996)
* an American physicist, historian and philosopher of science whose controversial 1962 book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions was influential in both academic and popular circles, introducing the term paradigm shift, which has since become an English-language idiom
* Kuhn made several notable claims concerning the progress of scientific knowledge: that scientific fields undergo periodic "paradigm shifts" rather than solely progressing in a linear and continuous way, and that these paradigm shifts open up new approaches to understanding what scientists would never have considered valid before; and that the notion of scientific truth, at any given moment, cannot be established solely by objective criteria but is defined by a consensus of a scientific community. Competing paradigms are frequently incommensurable; that is, they are competing and irreconcilable accounts of reality. Thus, our comprehension of science can never rely wholly upon "objectivity" alone. Science must account for subjective perspectives as well, since _all objective conclusions are ultimately founded upon the subjective conditioning/worldview of its researchers and participants_
* science is subjective (postmodernism)
* scientists bring own agendas/presuppositions to the subject of study
