## Notes
* Human-centered design is a creative approach to problem solving. It's a process that starts with the people you're designing for and ends with tailor-made solutions to meet their needs.
* Human-centered design is a process that can be used across industries and sectors to approach any number of challenges--from product and service design to space or systems design, to name just a few.
* The human-centered design process has 3 phases--Inspiration, Ideation and Implementation. In the Inspiration phase, you'll learn directly from the people you're designing for. In the Ideation phase, you'll make sense of what you learned, identify opportunities for design, and prototype possible solutions. And in the Implementation phase, you'll bring your solutions to life.

## Team Knowledge and Assumptions
 * What are the aspects of the challenge that you already know a lot about? What are your assumptions? 
 * Where are the aspects of the design challenge where you need to learn more? What don’t you know? 

 ## Plan Your Research
 * Learn from People
    * Who will you be designing for? Consider both the core user and the extended community. Imagine a map of all the people who might have something to do with your design challenge. Think of characteristics that would make them interesting to meet. Also consider speaking with users who represent extreme (as opposed to mainstream) viewpoints.
* Learn from Experts
    * Who are the inspiring researchers or organizations in the space of your design challenge? Successful members of the target population can also be great experts. A telephone or Skype call with experts who aren’t local often works very well.
* Immerse Yourself in Context
    * With a curious mindset, inspiration and new perspectives can be found in many places and without much preparation. Sharpen your skills and get started observing the world around you. Plan your observations by choosing places where you can have experiences that are relevant to your challenge.
* Seek Analagous Inspiration
    * What are the activities, emotions, and behaviors that make up the experience of your challenge? Now select similar scenarios that you would like to observe in places and situations that are different than your design challenge.
* Determine 3 people/places to interview/visit for each of the following:
    * people to learn from
    * experts to speak to
    * in-context immersion locations
    * analogous inspiration locations

## Build an Interview Guide
* Open General
    * What are some broad questions you can ask to open the conversation and warm people up?
    * Examples:
        * What do you do for a living?
        * Who makes up your family or household?
        * Describe your last family meal. Who was there? Where did it take place?
* Then Go Deep 
    * What are some questions that can help you start to understand this person’s hopes, fears, and ambitions?
    * Examples:
        * Draw your dream grocery aisle. What would be on the shelves, the coolers?
        * Describe your favorite meal. What do you love about it?
        * Imagine you can only eat one meal everyday. What would it be and why?
