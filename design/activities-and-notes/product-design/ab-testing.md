## Creativity
* personal creativity
* using materials of design to solve a problem in a unique way
* know you're done through intuition and critique
    * intuition - having an eye for what works
    * critique - checks and balances, defending ideas while being open to suggestions
* what it looks like?
    * experimentation
    * metaphorical matching
    * embracing serendipity
    * unconventional choices
    * iteration
* why should you use it?
    * making a statement
    * bring a strong point of view
    * create something with a clear identity
    * emotional reaction
    * reinvention
    * shift thinking
* what is it good for?
    * best for big change
    * new offers for new users
    * gifting: i know you haven't seen something like this before, but i think you'll like it
    * designer > user
* weakness
    * you don't always give people the right gift
    * your perspective isn't always the best
    * you could be building the wrong product

## Design Thinking
* what it looks like?
    * begin with people
    * in-context observation
    * empathy building - try to see the world through other people's eyes
        * breaking down our biases and worldviews
    * rapid prototyping, low fidelity, get feedback from users throughout the process
    * diverge and converge
        * cycles of abstract and concrete thinking
        * zomming in and out to see the problem at different scales
* why should I use it?
    * confidence in the solution
    * principles for future designs 
    * mitigate risk
    * reconnect with purpose behind what you are doing
* what is it good for?
    * new users, existing offers
    * old users, new offers - deepening relationships
    * here is the thing we made together 
    * user > designer

## A/B Testing
* what it looks like?
    * pick a quantifiable metric
    * create a design variation
    * split users into two buckets
    * collect data
    * determine the winner
* why should I use it?
    * actual behavior
    * very small differences
    * definitive answers
    * optimization
* what is it good for?
    * optimizing existing product for existing users
    * user behavior is looked at as an aggregate
* weaknesses
    * may not help with user experience
    * optimized for more engagement, but more engagement is not necessarily correlated with better experience

## Each Approach Has Their Own Place
* ungrounded creativity can lead to products that nobody wants or understands
* design thinking can get stuck in the present or remain too high-level
* A/B testing can be too narrow, and stymie holistic thinking

## Nuanced Combination (not Niched Combinations)
* what approach best answers my questions?
* how does approach influence my relationship to users?
* what might be the unintended consequences?
* A/B Testing can only be used for projects that have one clear, all-important goal, that's to say a single KPI (key performance indicator). Furthermore, this goal must be measurable by computer, by counting simple user actions. A/B Testing only works for fully-implemnted designs.. The biggest problem with A/B Testingis that you don't know why youg et the measured results. worst of all A/B Testing only provides data on the elemtn your'e testing. and yet. 
* scientific method has limitations for strategy and innovation
* the behavior of customers will never be transformed by a product whose design is based on an analysis of past behavior
* data is only ever backwards-looking
* longevity requires strategy and innovation, not optimization
