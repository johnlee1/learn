## Task 1
Describe your morning ritual.

## Solution
First I wake up, check the time, and use the bathroom. If I have time I'll eat breakfast, and then if I still have time I'll do some reading. Then I get changed, grab my keys, and go out the door.

## Task 2
Sketch what your design process looks like - or how it might look. How do you get from starting with a design task to a solution?

## Solution
At a very high level, I see the design process as having two major steps: determining the problem definition and creating a solution. Both of these steps should be executed with a user-centered approach.

#### Determining the problem definition
Defining the problem is looking at a very large problem space and doing research to come up with a specific problem definition. This involves gaining a deep understanding of the problem space and will require the designer to gain domain knowledge relevant to the problem space. Research may involve looking at historical data, extensive reading, and conducting interviews. Through research, the designer should gain the insight necessary to pinpoint a specific problem to be solved.

#### Creating a solution
Creating a solution can be difficult because it involves going from an infinite solution space to a single solution that best satisfies the problem definition. The first step is to look at the solution space and go through an ideation process to come up with several potential solutions. Next, through a process of validation, the single best solution should be selected. One way to do validation is to build prototypes of the potential solutions and test them with users. Prototyping and testing should help the designer see which solutions work, which solutions don't work, and why. This will help the designer narrow down the potential solutions to a single best solution. Validating a solution is invaluable because it ensures that the right product is being built. Next is to take the solution and go through an iterative process of design, build, and test until the solution satisfies the problem definition.

#### User-Centered Approach
A user-centered approach explicitly and holisitcally considers usability goals, user characteristics, user environment, and how a user will consume a product. Some tools for designing with a user-centered approach include story mapping, empathy mapping, and user testing.

## Task 3
Come up with three words that come into your mind when you think about design.

## Solution
problem-solving, structure, cool

## Notes
* the road is just as important as the destination
* there is a *process* that underlies the act of designing
* designing is about creating value and meaning to people
* product is a means to an end, and that end always relates to people
* a product is not valuable if it does not offer people the ability to do or experience something that is desirable
* a product is meaningless if it does not allow them to do so in a way that is appropriate to the context in which it is bought and used
* there is never a single right answer at the end of a design project
* designers require an attitude to want to engage with the complexity of a real world design problem
* designers require an attitude to tolerate uncertainty for extended periods of time
* designers require a motivation to dare to try out new ideas

## Task 4
Give three words that come to mind when you think about your own morning ritual.

## Solution
clean, fast, prepare

## Notes
* we can look at all designed items from three different levels/perspectives
* the first level is the what level (product level)
    * we look at products as they appear to us
    * materials, shape, weight, technical features
    * based on properties and features, people ascribe qualities or characteristics
* the second level is the how level (interaction level)
    * through interaction with a product, we see what the product means to people, what it allows them to do, and what experience it evokes
* the third level is the why level (context level)
    * look at the reasons why things are the way they are and what makes products meaningful to people
    * these reasons can have to do with the environment in which things are used, with technological possibilities and physical constraints
    * the main reason however is what people need and aspire, in what we consider important and valuable, in our concerns and expectations
