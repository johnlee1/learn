## Notes
* Empathize - getting out and talking to users directly
* Define - defining a problem statement from empathy work
* Ideate - generating lots of new ideas about what you might want to do to solve that problem
* Prototyping - building things to test your concepts
* Testing - testing with users

## Task 1
Interview someone about their last gift-giving experience.

## Solution
* 2 weeks ago
* souvenir
* for Sophie
* gift is whistle / compass / keychain 
* was at airport in Zurich, Switzerland and going to buy her a keychain but dad said to buy something useful
* got gift because felt like it
* then also got sister a gift
* when give a gift it shows that you are thinking about them
* Sophie got her a souvenir from Japan
* just go into the shop and see what is there
* knew was going to see Sophie
* presented tne gift by saying "I have something for you" and then gave the gift
* gave the gift while hanging out - casual
* Sophie laughed and said thank you
* Hannah doesn't remember how she felt
* felt normal when picking out the keychain
* asked Dad for helping to pick it
* picks gift when happens to see something and realize that a friend will like this
* when in Japan and saw a sumo wrestler postcard - thought of a friend
* rewarding to give gifts
* when picking - thinks about what they like and whether or not they have something
* give useful gift
* give not useful gift if the person think its funny or if they just like it
* the gift doesn't always have to have value
* just wants to show that he/she is my friend and that I care about him/her

## Task 2
Capture findings.

## Solution
* needs: things they are trying to do
    * show that they are thinking of the other person
    * show that they are a friend and that they are cared for

* insights: new learnings about your partner's feelings/worldview to leverage in your design
    * gift is casual
    * gift is found while traveling
    * gift doesn't have to have utility valuable
    * meaningful because friend is thought of while distant
    * its more about the friendship
    * not an emotional experience, casual

## Future steps
* Define the problem statement.
* Sketch 5 radical ways to meet your user's need.
* Share your solutions and capture feedback.
* Reflect and generate a new idea.
* Make a prototype of your solution.
* Share your solution and get feedback about what worked, what could be improved, questions, and ideas.
* Reflect on how did engaging with a real person and testing the prototype with a real person affect the direction the prototype took.
* Reflect on what it was like presenting unfinished work.
* Reflect on how it felt to go through quick iterative cycles.
* Reflect on what would you do differently if you could go back and do the whole design challenge over again.
* Reflect on what is the one thing you want to try tomorrow.

## Notes
* bias towards being human-centered. spending time with the people who are impacted by what you do. gain insights and have empathy.
* attitude of prototyping everything. getting ideas out there early to test what is working and what is not.
* attitude of collaboration. involve people who have diverse perspectives
* bias towards action.
