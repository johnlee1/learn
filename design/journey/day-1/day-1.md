## Task
Sketch what your design process looks like - or how it might look. How do you get from starting with a design task to a solution?

## Solution
At a very high level, I see the design process as having two major steps: determining the problem definition and creating a solution. Both of these steps should be executed with a user-centered approach.

#### Determining the problem definition
Defining the problem is looking at a very large problem space and doing research to come up with a specific problem definition. This involves gaining a deep understanding of the problem space and will probably require the designer to gain domain knowledge relevant to the problem space. Research may involve looking at historical data, extensive reading, and conducting interviews. Through research, the designer should gain the insight necessary to pinpoint a specific problem to be solved. 

#### Creating a solution
Creating a solution can be difficult because it involves going from an infinite solution space to a single solution that best satisfies the problem definition. The first step is to look at the solution space and go through an ideation process to come up with several potential solutions. Next, through a process of validation, the single best solution should be selected. One way to do validation is to build prototypes of the potential solutions and test them with users. Prototyping and testing should help the designer see which solutions work, which solutions don't work, and why. This will help the designer narrow down the potential solutions to a single best solution. Validating a solution is invaluable because it ensures that the right product is being built. Next is to take the solution and go through an iterative process of design, build, and test until the solution satisfies the problem definition.

## User-Centered Approach
A user-centered approach explicitly and holisitcally considers usability goals, user characteristics, user environment, and how a user will consume a product. Some tools for designing with a user-centered approach include story mapping, empathy mapping, and user testing.
