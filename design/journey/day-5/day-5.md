## Notes

### Ideation and Validation
* User Research
    * first make a list of questions you are trying to answer
* Market Demands and Trends
    * Keyword Evaluation (Google AdWords) What are people searching for? What do you notice after filtering the high volume keywords?
    * Content Competition (Google Search) What type of content appears in your searches? (articles or companies) Is this consistent for other keyword searches related to your idea?
    * Geographic Validation (Google Trends) Where do people live who are searching for related keywords? What barriers might exist to deliver the product or service?
    * Social Media Validation (Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest) What volume of people use keywords related to your idea? How are users talking about related ideas? Handy for communicating your idea and for marketing materials later.
* Value Proposition
    * value propositions serve to inform a customer what problem they are addressing and how the product is a solution to that problem
    * a value proposition is never permanent and may change as the market changes and how usersâ€™ needs change
    * a value proposition states a problem and a solution, but it can be molded to best communicate this message to a target audience
* Refining Your Idea
    * twitter description - how would you announce your product in 140 characters or less?
        * focus on key user value
    * future press release - how would your product first appear in the news?
        * capture future vision
    * one page executive summary
