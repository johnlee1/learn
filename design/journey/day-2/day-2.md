Week 1

## Notes
* the road is just as important as the destination
* there is a *process* that underlies the act of designing
* designing is about creating value and meaning to people
* product is a means to an end, and that end always relates to people
* a product is not valuable if it does not offer people the ability to do or experience something that is desirable
* a product is meaningless if it does not allow them to do so in a way that is appropriate to the context in which it is bought and used
* there is never a single right answer at the end of a design project
* designers require an attitude to want to engage with the complexity of a real world design problem
* designers require an attitude to tolerate uncertainty for extended periods of time
* designers require a motivation to dare to try out new ideas

## Task 1
Give three words that come to mind when you think about your own morning ritual.

## Solution
clean, fast, prepare

## Notes
* we can look at all designed items from three different levels/perspectives
* the first level is the what level (product level)
    * we look at products as they appear to us
    * materials, shape, weight, technical features
    * based on properties and features, people ascribe qualities or characteristics
* the second level is the how level (interaction level)
    * through interaction with a product, we see what the product means to people, what it allows them to do, and what experience it evokes
* the third level is the why level (context level)
    * look at the reasons why things are the way they are and what makes products meaningful to people
    * these reasons can have to do with the environment in which things are used, with technological possibilities and physical constraints
    * the main reason however is what people need and aspire, in what we consider important and valuable, in our concerns and expectations
