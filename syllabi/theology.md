# So You Want To Learn Theology?

## Introduction

This is my outline for what one would need to learn in order to really understand theology. All of the topics mentioned are core topics that would be covered in any typical seminary education.

Everyone learns differently, but what I see as the essentials to learning theology are..

## Church History

## Old Testament

## New Testament

## Doctrine of God
* No One Like Him - John Feinberg
* Knowing God - J. I. Packer
* Knowledge of the Holy - A. W. Tozer

## Christology
* Knowing Christ - Mark Jones

## Pneumatology

## Soteriology

## Ecclesiology

## Eschatology

## Apologetics
* The Reason for God - Tim Keller
