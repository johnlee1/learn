## Questions to Ask
* Does this aid promote the human dignity of those being aided?
* Does government program X increase affiliation and bonding or decrease them?
* Does charity practice Y make it more or less likely that recipients will get jobs?
* Is the church program Z based on categorization and discernment, or does it pat itself on the back for promiscuous material distribution?
* Do government and private programs increase the likelihood that a pregnant, unmarried teenager will be reunited with those on whom she actually is dependent, whether she wishes to admit it or not - parents, the child’s father - or do they offer a mirage of independence? (reuniting is better)
* Do programs encourage single-parenting? (they should not)
* Do fathers now effectively have the choice of providing or not providing? (they should not have the choice)
* Are boards of deacons often mere distributors of a “deacon’s fund” of cash donations and cans of food, or do they act as a switchboard to connect better-off congregation members with the needy? 
* Do churches convey through both words and programs the biblical messages of personal involvement and mutual obligation? (expect work on the part of those being aided too)
* Are there ways that governmental programs can encourage bonding? Cash contributions are tax deductible, but what about offering a room to a homeless person or to a pregnant and abandoned woman?

## General Notes
* Need to stop talking about the homeless in abstraction and start distinguishing between those who need a hand (such as the mentally ill and abandoned women with small children) and those who desperately need a push. (free hand outs to those who need a push is not the solution)
* In Washington, when Jack M. White started a residence two years ago to help homeless men find jobs and apartments, he began by simply asking the men not to use drugs or abuse alcohol. Only five percent made it through the four-month programs. He then decided to institute random urine tests for the residents and staff and to evict anyone using drugs. His success rate is now 75 percent. 
* Unlimited tolerance is an injustice, it is not love. In the absence of categorization, not only do many of the poor continue to wallow,but frustration among the better-off grows.
* An emphasis on freedom also should include a willingness to step away for a time and let those who have dug their own hole “suffer the consequences of their misconduct”. The early Calvinists knew that time spent in the pit could be what was needed to save a life from permanent debauch (and a soul from hell).
* The poor need both incentive and penalty
* If the goal is to supply material, neither government nor recipient is likely to demand change. Universalizing depersonalizers are popular among those of the poor who do not want anyone to challenge them. 
* New ways of fostering affiliation, bonding, categorizing, discernment, employment, and freedom are important - but in the end, not much will be accomplished without a spiritual revival that transforms the everyday advice people give and receive, and the way we lead our lives
* The christian story was told by John Timmer, a minister in Michigan who was a child in Holland half a century ago. His parents at that time hid Jews from the Nazis. In 1990 he asked, “Why did my parents do it? Why did they risk their own lives and possibly those of their six children? What madness possessed them to take such risks?” TImmer wrote, “The only reason I remember my father giving was this: ‘As God shows compassion to us, so we must show compassion to others.’” Timmer added, “These are words in which rescuers make themselves the equal of the rescued because both are equally dependent on the compassion of God.” That realization suffused American charity a century ago. Without it, the will to put up with all the problems of dealing with poverty, and the will to maintain moral realism, disappear.
* Only a richness of spirit can battle a poverty of soul
* Each of us needs to ask that question not in the abstract, but personally, we need to ask ourselves: are we offering not coerced silver, but our lives? If we talk of crisis pregnancies, are we actually willing to provide a home to a pregnant young woman? If we talk of abandoned children, are we actually willing to adopt a child? Most of our twentieth-century schemes, based on having someone else take action, are proven failures. It’s time to learn from the warm hearts and hard heads of earlier times, and to bring that understanding into our own lives.
* Don’t start planning by considering the funding or even what funds could be raised. Instead begin with what is right for the city and faithful to the gospel
* Consider how economic/social/religious/political systems are unjust/oppressive. Ask poor/minorities
* people/processes (good) vs projects/products (bad)
* When poor people look at your church, in what ways do they see the embodiment of Jesus Christ and the comprehensive healing of his kingdom
* Holistic framework
    * Relationship with God
    * Relationship with self
    * Relationship with others
    * Relationship with creation (work)
* Do the ministries to the poor with which you are involved narrate that God is the creator, sustainer, and redeemer of the technology resources, and methods that you are bringing? Or are you inadvertently communicating that the power is in the technology, resources, and methods?
