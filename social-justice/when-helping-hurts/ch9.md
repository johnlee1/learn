## material poverty alleviation:
* working to reconcile the four foundational relationships so that people can fulfill their callings of glorifying God by working and supporting themselves and their families with the fruit of that work
<br>
* God
* self
* others
* rest of creation
<br>
* economic
* social
* religious 
* political

## microfinance institute
* lend money to poor people, collection the money back, and then lend it out again. many poor people have been able to access capital at lower interest rates. money is perpetually recycled
* must convince borrowers that it will exist over the long haul. if borrowers do not believe the MFI will be there tomorrow, they will not worry about repaying their loans today, as the MFI will not be around to penalize them for not repaying
* very good at quickly injecting capital into microenterprises

### short-comings
* difficulties in providing savings services. research has found that many poor people (especially extreme/destitute poor) would rather save than borrow since saving is less risky than borrowing. MFI have historically focused on lending money and have not provided options for poor people to save. 
* failure to reach the extreme or destitute poor. it is difficult to find MFIs that can provide loans of less than forty dollars, and many cannot even provide loans that small. unfortunately, the extreme or destitute poor typically cannot handle loans this large, usually desiring loans in the five-to-twelve-dollar range. loan sizes that are too large and the absence of savings services make MFIs incapable of ministering to the extreme or destitute poor. hence MFIs are better able to help the “moderate poor” or vulnerable non-poor,” whose income levels are just below or just above the poverty line, respectively
* failure to reach the rural poor. it is much cheaper to lend money in areas with high population density because transportation costs per client are lower; hence, MFIs struggle to reach the poor living in rural areas, who account for nearly 75% of the total poor in the Majority World.
* exclusive focus on businesses. poor people need capital for their micro-enterprises, household improvements, emergencies, and life-cycle events such as weddings and funerals. MFIs tend to focus narrowly on finance for microenterprises, overlooking the fact that the poor need capital for a wide range of reasons
* lack of evangelism and discipleship activities. the pressure to stay in business is pushing most MFIs to reduce costs by cutting out all services other than loans and other financial products. but loans alone cannot reconcile people to God, self, others, and the rest of creation. Faith comes by hearing, not through borrowing money

## MF provider model: don’t try this at home!
* missionaries/churches are particularly ill-suited to provide loans for two reasons: 
    * lack technical, managerial, and financial resources to get big enough to make their loan program financially sustainable. when borrowers sense that the program is not sustainable over the long haul, they stop repaying their loans, thereby causing the program to go broke. to be viable, successful MFIs need thousands of clients, a number beyond the capacity of most missionaries/churches
    * missionaries/churches find it very difficult to balance their culture of grace with the discipline needed to enforce loan repayment. if the missionary/pastor will not enforce loan repayment for this widow, other borrowers will believe that they do not have to repay their loans, and the program will fail

## MF promotion model: microfinance without donor money
* savings and credit association (SCA)
* very simple credit union in which poor people save and lend their own money to one another 
* each member contributes an agreed-upon savings amount to the group’s fund at a weekly meeting. 
* the SCA members decide how much of the group’s fund to lend, to whom it will be lent, and the terms of the loans
* at the end of a predetermined length of time, usually six to twelve months, each member’s savings are returned along with dividends they have earned from the interest charged on loans
* microfinance without outside managers or money
* the role of the indigenous church/missionary in this model is simply to promote the group by facilitating its formation. church/missionary does not manage group or handle the money. church/missionary empowers the poor to do this for themselves, equipping them to create and manage a system for saving and borrowing the lump sums of money that they need
* group meetings provide an excellent context for evangelism and discipleship activities that may be offered by the missionary/church/groupmembers
* promoting SCAs has proven to be a highly effective and strategic intervention for indigenous churches and missionaries in the majority world for following reasons:
    * simple to facilitate, can work on a small scale, do not require the churches to lend and collect money
    * offer a way for poor people to save and even to earn interest on their savings
    * can work in both urban and rural areas
    * loan sizes in 5-12 dollar range are entirely feasible, as are loan sizes amounting to hundreds of dollars; hence, SCAs can minister to multiple levels of poverty, including the extreme poor
    * lump sums from SCAs can be used for the full range of households’ needs, not just financing business investments
    * because SCAs were originally developed by poor people, promoting them builds upon local knowledge. this fact, combined with the use of local savings, makes the promotion of SCAs consistent with an asset-based approach
    * SCAs can be promoted using highly participatory methods, allowing group members to make their own policies rather than prescribing such policies for them in a blueprint fashion
    * the fact that the SCAs can originate from the ministries of churches and missionaries makes it relatively easy to maintain evangelism and discipleship activities, thereby addressing brokenness at the individual level
* word-and-deed ministry 
* two problems with SCAs:
    * poor people sometimes struggle to manage their groups well, to keep accurate records, and to enforce discipline. Many MFIs perform better in all of these functions
    * SCAs do not mobilize large amounts of loan capital as quickly as MFIs do. group members can grow impatient with the process of saving money for loan capital, particularly if their business can handle larger loan sizes. 
* nevertheless, the promotion model is a viable alternative for addressing brokenness at both the systemic and individual levels for all ranges of poverty in the majority world

## the MF partnership model: linking arms in the fight against poverty
* works as long as the target population is not the extreme or destitute poor, who are unable to handle MFI loans
* MFI provides the financial services such as lending money and monitoring repayment. the churches/missionaries can offer a range of complementary services that the MFI typically cannot provide, such as evangelism and discipleship; individual counseling; emergency assistance; and training in small-business principles, household financial management, and related subjects from a biblical worldview perspective
* many churches/missionaries lack a holistic vision, believing that they are to care only for people’s spiritual needs
* MFIs often lack a holistic vision, believing that poverty alleviation can be achieved just by making capital available. often leery of churches whose culture of charity and grace have often resulted in horrible loan repayment rates

## the complementary training model: man does not live on capital alone
* complementing savings and loan services w/ appropriate training topics and methodologies can improve the businesses and lives of poor people
* integrate biblical worldview messages into technical curricula. in addition to training poor people in basic principles of small-business management, household financial literacy, and health-care topics (malaria, HIV/AIDS/diarrhea), the worldview messages apply a biblical understanding of the four key relationships to the lies of animism by emphasizing the themes of dignity, stewardship, and discipline
* specifically designed to be used in SCA group meetings, thereby augmenting the holistic nature of the promotion model
* churches/missionaries pursuing the partnership model could provide this complementary training to MFI client groups

## Business as Mission
* missionary owns and operates a legitimate, for-profit business that he uses as a vehicle for ministry
* while used to gain access to a closed country, provide income needed for a ministry, offering a natural context for developing * relationships
* poverty alleviation a major reason - provides employment opportunities
* intentionally develop relationships with employees, suppliers, and customers, opportunities for evangelism and discipleship abound
* observations about BAM
* likely to impact fewer poor people directly per ministry dollar than the promotion, partnership, or complementary training models. BAM enterprises are more sophisticated than microenterprises, requiring greater technical expertise and large amounts of capital per employee than in microenterprises. 
* compared to microenterprises, BAM enterprises bring greater enhancement to workers’ productivity through improved technology and larger amounts of capital. hence, while fewer people are directly impacted in BAM, those who are impacted are likely to experience a far greater increase in their incomes than in MF
* BAM is not for everyone. many churches/missionaries are not gifted at running businesses. moreover, even a person gifted at operating a business in north america will not necessarily be successful at doing so in a majority world country. the culture and business climate in some contexts may make north american business skills not completely transferable. the promotion, partnership, and complementary training models are all much simpler to pursue than BAM, thereby reducing the risk of harm
* churches/missionaries pursuing BAM need to be careful to avoid dependency-creating subsidies. for example, when missionaries operating in the majority world transport and market handcrafts to churches in north america, they create a dangerous situation. when the missionary retires, it might be impossible for the business to pay for the management, transportation, and marketing services that the missionary was providing. as a result, the business may fail, and poor employees may be left with nothing. BAM enterprises must be real businesses, covering all of their costs, both explicit and implicit

## the role of the north american church
* financially subsidize the training of missionaries and majority world churches so that they can implement the promotion, partnership, and complementary training models. do not pay all the costs of this training, however, as people usually place greater value on things that they have paid something to receive
* become a trainer of trainers. although missionaries/indigenous churches are better positioned for frontline ministry to the poor than Christians living in North America, some North Americans have sufficient training gifts to help expose those on the front lines to new models, tools, and curricula. training teams comprised both of north american and majority world trainers
* provide funds for MFIs to add evangelism and discipleship components to their program. if a MFI is already financially sustainable, do not donate money for loan capital, since a financially sustainable MFI can raise such funds on international capital markets
* consider investing financial and human resources in support of a BAM enterprise
* become an advocate for MF and BAM by finding organizations that share your vision and supporting those organizations through prayers, networking, and financial assistance
