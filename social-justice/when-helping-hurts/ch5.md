### asset-based community development
* instead of looking outside the low-income indiivdual.community for resources and solutions, ABCD starts by asking the materially poor how they can be stewards of their own gifts and resources
* the very nature of the question - What gifts do you have? - affirms people’s dignity and contributes to the process of overcoming their poverty of being
* don’t view as clients or beneficiaries 
* questions to ask:
    * what assets do you have?
    * what needs must be addressed?
    * how can you use your assets to address those needs?
* if needs become pressing and there are not enough assets to address all of the needs, it then becomes appropriate to bring in outside resources to augment local assets
* it is important that the outside resources do not undermine the willingness or the ability of the poor individual/community to be stewards of their own gifts and resources
* when bringing in outside resources we ask 1) is it too much? 2) is it too early?
