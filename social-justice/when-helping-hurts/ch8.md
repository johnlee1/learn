## poor people in North America could benefit from all of the following:
* the ability to work at jobs with living wages
* the capacity to manage their money
* the opportunity to accumulate wealth
* a greater supply of quality education, housing, and health care at affordable rates
* highly relational ministries - delivered through the body of Jesus Christ - that help them to overcome the effects of the fall on their individual hearts, minds, and behaviors

## economic development interventions similar in that they all use
* use development rather than relief, because the vast majority of poor people in North America are capable of participating in the improvement of their lives
* improve some aspect of the economic system or enable poor people to use the existing system more effectively; 
* use an asset-based approach that builds upon the skills, intelligence, labor, discipline, savings, creativity, and courage of poor people
* have the potential to be designed, implemented, and evaluated in a participatory manner
* provide an opportunity to use biblically based curricula, allowing for a clear presentation of the gospel and the addressing of worldview issues;
* use church-based mentoring teams that can offer love, support, and encouragement, thereby providing a relational approach that seeks to restore people’s dignity (relationship to self), community (relationship to others), stewardship (relationship to the rest of creation), and spiritual intimacy (relationship to God)
* are implemented over fairly long periods of time, thereby creating space for “development,” the process of ongoing change and reconciliation, for both the “helpers” and the “helped”

## Job Preparedness Ministries
* classroom training for poor people that emphasizes the development of “soft skills” from a biblical perspective. soft skills are general, nontechnical abilities such as a solid work ethic, the ability to function in a team, and strong communication skills.  addresses issues such as career planning, the inherent value of work, goot attitudes, personal integrity, respect for authority,  conflict resolution, responsibility, punctuality, appropriate dress, etc.
* mentors provide support and encouragement to participants, helping them to overcome obstacles that hinder their ability to complete the class, to get a job, or to cope with life. 
* business covenant to provide interviews, job opportunities, and supportive work environments to graduates. ideally employers will be in contact with the mentors

## Financial Education Ministires
* basic financial education using biblically based curricula
* Christian stewardship, budgeting, goal setting, saving, debt reduction, record keeping, tithing, taxes, banking, managing credit
* choosing curriculum based on target population’s educational level, training needs, cultural characteristics, learning styles, and worldview issues. if range of populations then need to use multiple curricula

## Wealth Accumulation Ministires
* encouraging poor people to save money out of their earned income
* people’s savings are matched in ratios that typically range from one-to-one to three-to-one as long as the savings and matched funds are used to acquire an asset such as a house, business, capital, education, a car, etc. the matching funds are released to the vendor of the asset - for instance a mortgage lender - to ensure that the funds are used for their intended purpose. matching funds can come from churches, individual donors, foundations, financial institutions, and federal and state governments 
* during the time that the participants are saving - a period that averages 2-3 years - they are typically provided with financial education that seeks to improve their capacity for budgeting and managing their resources. in addition, there is usually training related to the asset the participant wants to purchase, such as small-business management training or home ownership courses
