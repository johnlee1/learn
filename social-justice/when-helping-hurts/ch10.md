## principle #1: foster triggers for human change
* prayer is the central tool in the development process
* change begins when something triggers the individual/group to reflect upon their current situation and to think about a possible future situation that they would prefer
* three common triggers:
    * recent crisis
    * burden of the status quo becoming so overwhelming that they want to pursue change
    * introduction of a new way of doing or seeing things that could improve their lives

## principle #2: mobilize supportive people
* large group gathering
    * reaffirming core principles
    * sharing about positive developments in their lives
    * learning about a relevant topic (job preparedness, financial education, individual development accounts)
* forming circles of support
    * if and when a participant wants to form a circle of support, they ask the allies of their choice if they would be willing to join their circle
    * allies are free to accept or decline
    * avoids awkwardness of many approaches to mentoring in which mentors and mentees, who have never even met before, are simply preassigned to one another and told to make it work
    * using a team of people rather than just one ally per participant
    * team-based approach has significant advantages including helping prevent volunteer burnout; mobilizing a broader diversity of gifts and capacities; and increasing the number of volunteers’ social networks that a participant can access
* circle of support meetings
    * each circle meets monthly
    * participant leads circle by presenting their “dream path”
    * participant and allies then brainstorm together to help the participant create the steps they would like to take to reach their goals
    * participant then decides on a concrete step to take and may describe whatever assistance they would like from the allies
    * the allies are free to decide if and how they would like to respond
    * participant with the help and support of their allies, then acts on their decision
    * allies don’t impose their own dreams but correct when dreams are ungodly/unrealistic

## principle #3: look for an early, recognizable success
* change is difficult and in order for people to be willing to go through the pain of change,they must have adequate enthusiasm and drive to motivate them to make initial changes and to sustain them throughout the process.
* people’s enthusiasm/drive are directly related to the degree that they are participating in the selection, design, implementation, and evaluation of the planned intervention
* but participation alone will not give people the enthusiasm and drive to persevere for very long
* to motivate people, participation typically must be accompanied by early and recognizable success toward the goals that the participants deem to be important
* early and recognizable success also important to generate enthusiasm and drive for those helping the materially poor
* start small, start soon, and succeed

## principle #4: Learn the Context as You Go
* don’t start too soon but don’t rush in too quickly 
* learning as you go: walk with people, try something together; reflect on the experience, together; decide to try something additional, together; reflect again; try again

#5 Start with the People Most Receptive to Change
