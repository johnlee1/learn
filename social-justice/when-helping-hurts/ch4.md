### avoid paternalism
* do not do things for people that they can do for themselves
* the goal is not to produce houses or other material goods but to pursue a process of walking with the materially poor so that they are better stewards of their lives and communities
* first step in thinking about working with the poor in any context is to discern whether the situation calls for relief, rehabilitation, or development
 
### relief
* urgent and temporary provision of emergency aid to reduce immediate suffering from a natural or man-made crisis
* people are nearly or completely helpless and experience plummeting economic conditions
* provider gives assistance to the receiver, who is largely incapable of helping himself at that time
* questions to ask:
    * is there really a crisis at hand?
    * if you fail to provide immediate help, will there really be serious, negative consequences?
    * to what degree was the individual personally responsible for the crisis?
    * can the person help himself?
    * to what extent has this person already been receiving relief from you or others in the past?
    * how likely is he to be receiving such help in the future?
* people often in this category:
    * severely disabled
    * some of the elderly
    * very young, orphaned children
    * mentally ill homeless population
    * victims of natural disaster
* effective relief: seldom, immediate, temporary
 
### rehabilitation
* restore people to the positive elements of their pre-crisis conditions
* working with the victims
* ensure participation of the affected population in the assessment, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the assistance program
* conduct an initial assessment to provide an understanding of the disaster situation and to determine the nature of the response
* respond when needs of an affected population are unmet by local people or organizations due to their inability or unwillingness to help
* target assistance based on vulnerability and need, and provide it equitably and impartially
* aid workers must possess appropriate qualifications, attitudes, and experience to plan and effectively implement appropriate assistance programs
 
### development
* process of ongoing change that moves all the people involved closer to being in right relationship with God, self, others, and the rest of creation
